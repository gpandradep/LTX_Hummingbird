	abstract = {Aim  There is a debate as to whether biotic interactions exert a dominant role in governing species distributions at macroecological scales. The prevailing idea is that climate is the key limiting factor; thus models that use present-day climate–species range relationships are expected to provide reasonable means to quantify the impacts of climate change on species distributions. However, there is little empirical evidence that biotic interactions would not constrain species distributions at macroecological scales. We examine this idea, for the first time, and provide tests for two null hypotheses: (H0 1) – biotic interactions do not exert a significant role in explaining current distributions of a particular species of butterfly (clouded Apollo, Parnassius mnemosyne) in Europe; and (H0 2) – biotic interactions do not exert a significant role in predictions of altered species’ ranges under climate change. Location  Europe. Methods  Generalized additive modelling (GAM) was used to investigate relationships between species and climate; species and host plants; and species and climate + host plants. Because models are sensitive to the variable selection strategies utilised, four alternative approaches were used: AIC (Akaike's Information Criterion), BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), BRUTO (Adaptive Backfitting), and CROSS (Cross Selection). Results  In spite of the variation in the variables selected with different methods, both hypotheses (H0 1 and H0 2) were falsified, providing support for the proposition that biotic interactions significantly affect both the explanatory and predictive power of bioclimatic envelope models at macro scales. Main conclusions  Our results contradict the widely held view that the effects of biotic interactions on individual species distributions are not discernible at macroecological scales. Results are contingent on the species, type of interaction and methods considered, but they call for more stringent evidence in support of the idea that purely climate-based modelling would be sufficient to quantify the impacts of climate change on species distributions.},

	abstract = {There is growing recognition of the important roles played by predators in regulating ecosystems and sustaining biodiversity. Much attention has focused on the consequences of predator-regulation of herbivore populations, and associated trophic cascades. However apex predators may also control smaller 'mesopredators' through intraguild interactions. Removal of apex predators can result in changes to intraguild interactions and outbreaks of mesopredators ('mesopredator release'), leading in turn to increased predation on smaller prey. Here we provide a review and synthesis of studies of predator interactions, mesopredator release and their impacts on biodiversity. Mesopredator suppression by apex predators is widespread geographically and taxonomically. Apex predators suppress mesopredators both by killing them, or instilling fear, which motivates changes in behaviour and habitat use that limit mesopredator distribution and abundance. Changes in the abundance of apex predators may have disproportionate (up to fourfold) effects on mesopredator abundance. Outcomes of interactions between predators may however vary with resource availability, habitat complexity and the complexity of predator communities. There is potential for the restoration of apex predators to have benefits for biodiversity conservation through moderation of the impacts of mesopredators on their prey, but this requires a whole-ecosystem view to avoid unforeseen negative effects.

	abstract = {Predicting which species will occur together in the future, and where, remains one of the greatest challenges in ecology, and requires a sound understanding of how the abiotic and biotic environments interact with dispersal processes and history across scales. Biotic interactions and their dynamics influence species' relationships to climate, and this also has important implications for predicting future distributions of species. It is already well accepted that biotic interactions shape species' spatial distributions at local spatial extents, but the role of these interactions beyond local extents (e.g. 10 km2 to global extents) are usually dismissed as unimportant. In this review we consolidate evidence for how biotic interactions shape species distributions beyond local extents and review methods for integrating biotic interactions into species distribution modelling tools. Drawing upon evidence from contemporary and palaeoecological studies of individual species ranges, functional groups, and species richness patterns, we show that biotic interactions have clearly left their mark on species distributions and realised assemblages of species across all spatial extents. We demonstrate this with examples from within and across trophic groups. A range of species distribution modelling tools is available to quantify species environmental relationships and predict species occurrence, such as: (i) integrating pairwise dependencies, (ii) using integrative predictors, and (iii) hybridising species distribution models (SDMs) with dynamic models. These methods have typically only been applied to interacting pairs of species at a single time, require a priori ecological knowledge about which species interact, and due to data paucity must assume that biotic interactions are constant in space and time. To better inform the future development of these models across spatial scales, we call for accelerated collection of spatially and temporally explicit species data. Ideally, these data should be sampled to reflect variation in the underlying environment across large spatial extents, and at fine spatial resolution. Simplified ecosystems where there are relatively few interacting species and sometimes a wealth of existing ecosystem monitoring data (e.g. arctic, alpine or island habitats) offer settings where the development of modelling tools that account for biotic interactions may be less difficult than elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Abstract.  The shift in emphasis from single species to ecosystem conservation is revealing how community interactions can potentially influence single species viability and conservation. Although there is much theory and empirical data concerning the dynamic consequences of exploitative interactions, there is still a very poor understanding of the effects of interference interactions. Recent studies, as shown in this review, have documented widespread effects of such interactions among mammalian carnivores. Harassment, loss of kills and intraguild predation have been documented in a wide range of species. The demonstrated effects also include avoidance of larger carnivores in both time and space and reductions in one species density or even total exclusion from certain habitats or regions. Our review of the literature thus provides a range of empirical examples that together demonstrate that these interactions have very important implications on carnivore demography. We believe that the effects of interference might differ strongly from the effects of exploitative competition. This is because interference might have the potential to affect population growth in an inverse density-dependent manner and thereby also reduce population growth at low densities, therefore increasing extinction probabilities. These factors need to be considered when planning future multi-species conservation. Further research into the temporal and spatial aspects of co-existence are required if diverse guilds and communities are to be conserved.},

Descriptive data can only be consistent in the predictions of hypotheses, although inconsistencies clearly imply falsification of such hypotheses. A three-phase procedure that can be used to specify the influence of interspecific competition on guild structure is presented. These phases are: (1) measurement of overlap of resource usage (@? descriptive data); (2) establishment of interaction, which entails the experimental demonstration that the presence of other species leads to altered patterns of resource usage; and (3) demonstration of depressive competition, in which the interaction is shown to be responsible for altered characteristics of populations (e.g., population density, age-structure, etc.) or individuals within the populations (e.g., fecundity, mortality, relative fitness). The potential drawbacks associated with the experimental demonstration of interaction or depressive competition are listed. These include the relative strengths of interspecific and intraspecific density effects, choices of times and locations for perturbations, possible effects of competitive mutualism, frequency-dependent predation, and choice of variables with which to assess competition. Depressive competition has been adequately shown to occur in a number of studies, particularly those that concentrate on small guilds (less than six species). Functional organization will be more difficult to show or delineate in guilds consisting of larger numbers of species because such guilds are more likely to be influenced by alternative processes.},

Background The largest terrestrial species in the order Carnivora are wide-ranging and rare because of their positions at the top of food webs. They are some of the world’s most admired mammals and, ironically, some of the most imperiled. Most have experienced substantial population declines and range contractions throughout the world during the past two centuries. Because of the high metabolic demands that come with endothermy and large body size, these carnivores often require large prey and expansive habitats. These food requirements and wide-ranging behavior often bring them into conflict with humans and livestock. This, in addition to human intolerance, renders them vulnerable to extinction. Large carnivores face enormous threats that have caused massive declines in their populations and geographic ranges, including habitat loss and degradation,persecution, utilization, and depletion of prey. We highlight how these threats can affect theconservation status and ecological roles of this planet’s 31 largest carnivores.

Seven species of large carnivores with documented ecological effects involving (A) “tri-trophic cascades” from large carnivores to prey to plants, (B) “mesopredator cascades” from large carnivores to mesopredators to prey of mesopredators, and (C) both tri-trophic and mesopredator cascades.

Advances Based on empirical studies, trophic cascades have been documented for 7 of the 31 largest mammalian carnivores (not including pinnipeds). For each of these species (see figure), human actions have both caused declines and contributed to recovery, providing “natural experiments” for quantifying their effects on food-web and community structure. Large carnivores deliver economic and ecosystem services via direct and indirect pathways that help maintain mammal, avian, invertebrate,and herpetofauna abundance or richness. Further, they affect other ecosystem processes and conditions, such as scavenger subsidies, disease dynamics, carbon storage, stream morphology, and crop production. The maintenance or recovery of ecologically effective densities of large carnivores is an important tool for maintaining the structure and function of diverse ecosystems.
Outlook Current ecological knowledge indicates that large carnivores are necessary for the maintenanceof biodiversity and ecosystem function. Human actions cannot fully replace the role of large carnivores. Additionally, the future of increasing human resource demands and changing climate will affect biodiversity and ecosystem resiliency. These facts, combined with the importance of resiliente cosystems, indicate that large carnivores and their habitats should be maintained and restored wherever possible. Preventing the extinction of these species and the loss of their irreplaceable ecological function and importance will require novel, bold, and deliberate actions. We propose a Global Large Carnivore Initiative to coordinate local, national, and international research, conservation, and policy.
Preserving Predators
Large-bodied animals play essential roles in ecosystem structuring and stability through both indirect and direct trophic effects. In recent times, humans have disrupted this trophic structure through both habitat destruction and active extirpation of large predators, resulting in large declines in numbers and vast contractions in their geographic ranges. Ripple et al. (10.1126/science.1241484; see the Perspective by Roberts) review the status, threats, and ecological importance of the 31 largest mammalian carnivores globally. These species are responsible for a suite of direct and indirect stabilizing effects in ecosystems. Current levels of decline are likely to result in ecologically ineffective population densities and can lead to ecosystem instability. The preservation of large carnivores can be challenging because of their need for large ranges and their potential for human conflict. However, the authors demonstrate that the preservation of large carnivores is ecologically important and that the need for conservation action is immediate, given the severity of the threats they face.
Large carnivores face serious threats and are experiencing massive declines in their populations and geographic ranges around the world. We highlight how these threats have affected the conservation status and ecological functioning of the 31 largest mammalian carnivores on Earth. Consistent with theory, empirical studies increasingly show that large carnivores have substantial effects on the structure and function of diverse ecosystems. Significant cascading trophic interactions, mediated by their prey or sympatric mesopredators, arise when some of these carnivores are extirpated from or repatriated to ecosystems. Unexpected effects of trophic cascades on various taxa and processes include changes to bird, mammal, invertebrate, and herpetofauna abundance or richness; subsidies to scavengers; altered disease dynamics; carbon sequestration; modified stream morphology; and crop damage. Promoting tolerance and coexistence with large carnivores is a crucial societal challenge that will ultimately determine the fate of Earth’s largest carnivores and all that depends upon them, including humans.},

	abstract = {Many important issues in community ecology revolve around the interplay of competition and predation. Species that compete may also be locked in predator-prey interactions, a mixture of competition and predation known as "intraguild predation" (IGP). There is growing evidence for the importance of IGP in many natural communities, yet little formal ecological theory addresses this particular blend of interactions. In this article, we explore the consequences of incorporating IGP into standard models of exploitative competition and food chains (a general resource-consumer model, a Lotka-Volterra food chain model, and Schoener's exploitative competition model). Our theoretical analyses suggest a general criterion for coexistence in IGP systems: the intermediate species (the prey in intraguild predation) should be superior at exploitative competition for the shared resource, whereas the top species (the predator) should gain significantly from its consumption of the intermediate species. Along gradients in environmental productivity, coexistence is most likely at intermediate levels of productivity. Analyses of the models reveal the potential for alternative stable states in systems with IGP; these are particularly likely if the top predator gains little benefit from consuming the intermediate predator. We further show that IGP can lead to unstable population dynamics, even when all pairwise interactions are inherently stable and each species can increase when rare. Persistent, strong IGP raises a puzzle of species coexistence, particularly in productive environments. We conclude by comparing IGP with related community modules (i.e., food chains, exploitative competition, apparent competition) and discussing mechanisms that should foster coexistence in systems with strong IGP.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of intraguild predation (IGP) in productive environments has long puzzled ecologists. Theory predicts the exclusion of intraguild prey from such environments, but data consistently defy this expectation. This suggests that coexistence mechanisms at high resource productivity may differ from those at lower productivity. Here I present a mathematical model that investigates multiple coexistence mechanisms. I incorporate two biological features widely observed in IGP communities: intraspecific interference via cannibalism or superparasitism, and temporal refuges arising from differential sensitivities to abiotic variation. I develop predictions based on three aspects of the IG prey–IG predator interaction: mutual invasibility, transient dynamics, and long-term abundances. These predictions specify the conditions under which coexistence mechanisms reinforce vs. deter one another: when a competition–IGP trade-off allows coexistence at intermediate productivity a temporal refuge for the intraguild prey always allows coexistence at high productivity, but intraspecific interference does so only at a net fitness cost to the intraguild predator. Intraspecific interference that benefits the intraguild predator not only reduces trade-off-mediated coexistence at intermediate productivity, but also undermines the refuge's coexistence-enhancing effect at high productivity. Different mechanism combinations yield characteristic signatures in time series data during transient dynamics. By judicious measurement of parameters and examining time series for critical signatures, one can elucidate the mechanisms that allow IGP to prevail in resource-rich environments.},

	abstract = {The commonness of omnivory in natural communities is puzzling, because simple dynamic models of tri-trophic systems with omnivory are prone to species extinction. In particular, the intermediate consumer is frequently excluded by the omnivore at high levels of enrichment. It has been suggested that adaptive foraging by the omnivore may facilitate coexistence, because the intermediate consumer should persist more easily if it is occasionally dropped from the omnivore's diet. We explore theoretically how species permanence in tri-trophic systems is affected if the omnivore forages adaptively according to the “diet rule”, i.e., feeds on the less profitable of its two prey species only if the more profitable one is sufficiently rare. We show that, compared to systems where omnivory is fixed, adaptive omnivory may indeed facilitate 3-species persistence. Counter to intuition, however, facilitation of 3-species coexistence requires that the intermediate consumer is a more profitable prey than the basal resource. Consequently, adaptive omnivory does not facilitate persistence of the intermediate consumer but enlarges the persistence region of the omnivore towards parameter space where a fixed omnivore would be excluded by the intermediate consumer. Overall, the positive effect of adaptive omnivory on 3-species persistence is, however, small. Generally, whether omnivory is fixed or adaptive, 3-species permanence is most likely when profitability (=conversion efficiency into omnivores) is low for basal resources and high for intermediate consumers.},

	abstract = {Intraguild predation (IGP) is a widespread ecological phenomenon in which two consumers that share a resource also engage in a predator–prey interaction. Theory on IGP predicts the occurrence of alternative stable states, but empirical evidence of such states is scarce. This raises the question of whether alternative states are a rare phenomenon that is unlikely to be observed in nature. Here we analyze a model in which the resource exhibits logistic or chemostat dynamics and consumers have saturating (Type II) functional responses. We show that alternative states can arise for a wide range of biological scenarios and that environmental constraints can make their detection difficult. Our analysis identifies three possible combinations of alternative states: (i) IG prey or IG predator, (ii) coexistence or IG predator, and (iii) coexistence or IG prey. Bifurcation diagrams reveal that alternative states are possible over large regions of the parameter space. However, they can be limited to narrow ranges along the resource productivity axis, which may make it difficult to observe the occurrence of alternative states in communities with IGP. Microcosm experiments provide a promising avenue for detecting combinations of asymptotically stable states along a productivity gradient.},

	abstract = {Intraguild predation (IGP) is an extreme form of competition that involves a dominant predator (IG predator), a subordinate predator that is also a superior exploitative competitor (IG prey), and their shared prey. Theory predicts three possible equilibria, which parallel increasing resource enrichment: exclusion of the IG predator, stable coexistence, and exclusion of the IG prey. Here, we report on the existence of two concurrent states in a model carnivore system dominated by IGP. Using species occurrence data obtained from randomly distributed remote cameras, we modeled the probabilities of detection and occupancy of the kit fox (Vulpes macrotis) and its IG predator, the coyote (Canis latrans), at White Sands National Monument, New Mexico, USA, using a recently developed conditional two-species occupancy model. Kit foxes persisted in habitats of low resource abundance, which could not support coyotes. Coexistence occurred in adjacent habitats of higher resource enrichment, with coyote occupancy strongly correlated with small mammal abundance. The odds of a coyote being present vs. absent in prey-rich habitats was 332:1 (± 0.006; SE) whereas the odds of a coyote being present vs. absent in prey-poor habitats was 1:4 (± 0.11); thus, coyotes were much more likely to be present in prey-rich habitats. Kit foxes were more frequently photographed in prey-poor habitats avoided by coyotes. The odds of kit foxes being present vs. absent at a site where coyotes were absent was 7.9:1 (± 0.082), which was greater than the odds of kit foxes being present vs. absent at a site where coyotes were present (2.2:1 ± 0.081). These findings indicate that kit foxes avoid coyotes, but that their adaptations to arid conditions enable them to exploit habitats unsuitable for coyotes. Consequently, the primary driver of this spatial separation is the inability of coyotes to use prey-poor habitats, rather than kit fox avoidance of coyotes. Our results reveal the existence of concurrent IGP states within the same ecological community, which is consistent with theoretical predictions, and highlight the power of the conditional two-species occupancy model to illuminate how the abundance of shared prey shapes the competitive dynamic in ecological systems dominated by IGP.},

However, trophic cascade theory and the mesopredator release hypothesis predict that the removal of top predators will result in the reorganization of trophic webs and loss of biodiversity. Using field data collected throughout arid Australia, we provide evidence that removal of an alien top-predator, the dingo, has cascading effects through lower trophic levels. Dingo removal was linked to increased activity of herbivores and an invasive mesopredator, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and to the loss of grass cover and native species of small mammals. Using species distribution data, we predict that reintroducing or maintaining dingo populations would produce a net benefit for the conservation of threatened native mammals across greater than 2.42 × 106 km2 of Australia. Our study provides evidence that an alien top predator can assume a keystone role and be beneficial for biodiversity conservation, and also that mammalian carnivores more generally can generate strong trophic cascades in terrestrial ecosystems.},

In this article we review the ecological role of the mesocarnivore and present examples where mesocarnivores drive community structure and function in roles similar to, or altogether different from, their larger brethren. Together, these examples substantiate the need for an assessment of the ecological role of mammalian carnivores beyond an examination of only the largest species.

Here we describe general food web theory and the potential application of network theory to it; summarise the possible roles of predators in food webs; document the occurrence, diet and presumed functions that canids play in food webs throughout the world; give case studies of four threatened canid species of top, middle and basal trophic positions and six anthropogenically affected species; and identify knowledge limitations and propose research frameworks necessary to establish the roles of canids in food webs. Canids can be top-down drivers of systems or responsive to the availability of resources including suitable prey. They can be affected anthropogenically by habitat change, lethal control and changes to basic resource availability. They can be sustainable yield harvesters of their indigenous prey or passengers in complex ecosystems, and some are prey of larger canids and of other predators. Nevertheless, the roles of most canids are generally poorly studied and described, and some, e.g. Gray Wolves, Coyotes and Australian dingoes, are controversial. We advocate mensurative and experimental research into communities and ecosystems containing canids for a quantitative understanding of their roles in food webs and consequent development of better management strategies for ecosystems.},

Intraguild predation may suppress the distribution and abundance of mesopredators, but spatial resource partitioning may facilitate coexistence, with the subordinate carnivore utilizing suboptimal habitats. In arid systems, free-standing water was historically scarce, limiting the distribution of larger-bodied predators and offering large areas of refugia for smaller, arid-adapted species, such as the kit fox (Vulpes macrotis). In these systems, the development of artificial water sources may facilitate an increase in the distribution and abundance of larger carnivores (e.g., coyotes [Canis latrans]), perhaps to the detriment of kit foxes. We coupled noninvasive genetic sampling and dynamic occupancy models to evaluate the spatial dynamics of kit foxes and their intraguild predators, coyotes, in western Utah, United States. We evaluated the influence of habitat characteristics on coyote occupancy patterns, and then investigated the role of habitat and coyotes on kit fox space use at multiple scales. Coyote occupancy was unrelated to water availability, but was positively related to the proportion of shrubland and woodland cover, a pattern consistent with predictions of the resource availability hypothesis. Supporting predictions of IGP theory, kit fox occupancy was negatively related to shrubland and woodland cover, minimizing overlap with land-cover types favoring coyote occupancy. Furthermore, kit fox probability of local extinction was positively related to coyote activity. Interestingly, kit fox detection was positively related to coyote activity (i.e., kit fox detection was higher on spatial surveys with greater coyote sign), suggesting that at finer scales, kit foxes utilized riskier habitats to secure sufficient resources. Our results identified two alternative states predicted by IGP theory (i.e., intraguild predator dominated and coexistence of intraguild predator and intraguild prey) in a single system and elucidated the importance of considering dynamic processes and scale when investigating IGP.},

Population trends of kit foxes appeared to be strongly influenced by food availability, but competition from coyotes also may have affected population dynamics of kit foxes. Mechanisms employed by kit foxes, such as resource partitioning, greater dietary breadth, and year-round den use, may facilitate coexistence with coyotes.

In the Great Basin Desert, USA, coyotes (\textit{Canis latrans} Say, 1823) have colonized and are now sympatric with native kit foxes (\textit{Vulpes macrotis} Merriam, 1888). Since both species have similar diets, dietary partitioning may facilitate coexistence. We analyzed coyote and kit fox diets, then compared our results to an earlier study. Because populations are dynamic, we expected that decreases in prey or increases in predator abundance could alter dietary patterns. We found no significant changes in population-level prey diversity for kit foxes or coyotes, and high levels of dietary overlap between species. We did detect a significant decrease in the relative importance of leporids (family Leporidae Fischer, 1817) in both canid’s diets, but they remained important for coyotes. The relative importance of small mammals was greater for kit foxes than coyotes, but their importance had not chang...},

	abstract = {Captures of San Joaquin kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis mutica) during annual livetrapping sessions at the California Army National Guard Training Site, Camp Roberts, decreased from 103 to 20 individuals from 1988 to 1991. This decrease continued through 1997 when only three kit foxes were captured. Similar trends in relative abundance were evident in scent-station visitations and spotlighting observations. An outbreak of rabies virus may have contributed to this catastrophic decrease in abundance because two foxes were found dead due to rabies in 1990. Striped skunks (Mephitus mephitus) are the primary vectors of rabies virus in this region and a rabid skunk was trapped at Camp Roberts during 1989. Captures of foxes were positively correlated with captures of skunks and negatively correlated with proportions of rabies-positive skunks submitted for testing to the San Luis Obispo Co. Public Health Department during the previous 2 years. Interference competition by coyotes (Canis latrans) also may have contributed to this catastrophic decrease because relative abundances of foxes and coyotes were negatively correlated from 1988 to 1997, and coyotes were responsible for 59\% of fox deaths during a 4-year telemetry study (1988 to 1991). The negative effects of inbreeding and interference competition by coyotes may hamper the recovery of this relatively-isolated population of foxes or eventually lead to its extinction if recruitment continues to be poor. /// Capturas de zorros (Vulpes macrotis mutica) durante sesiones anuales de trampeo vivo en el California Army National Guard Training Site, Camp Roberts, bajaron de 103 a 20 individuos de 1988 a 1991. El decremento continuó hasta 1997 cuando sólo se capturaron tres zorros. Tendencias similares de abundancias relativas fueron evidentes en visitas a estaciones aromatizadas y observaciones nocturnas con lámpara. Un brote del virus de rabia tal vez contribuyó al decremento catastrófico de la abundancia porque dos zorros se encontraron muertos de rabia en 1990. Zorrillos (Mephitus mephitus) son los vectores principales del virus de rabia en esta región y un zorrillo rabioso fue capturado en Camp Roberts durante 1989. Capturas de zorros fueron positivamente correlacionados con capturas de zorrillos y negativamente correlacionados con proporciones de zorrillos con rabia sometidos a examen en el departamento de salud del condado de San Luis Obispo durante los dos años previos. Competencia de interferencia por coyotes (Canis latrans) quizás también contribuyó al decremento catastrófico porque las abundancias relativas de zorros y coyotes fueron negativamente correlacionadas de 1988 a 1997, y coyotes fueron responsables por 59\% de las muertas de zorros durante un estudio telemétrico de 1988 a 1991. Los efectos negativos de cruzamiento consanguíneo y competencia de interferencia por coyotes quizás impiden la recuperación de esta población de zorros relativamente aislada de zorros o eventualmente llevarán a su extincion si el reclutamiento sigue siendo malo.},

De los 299 componentes-presas identificados en la temporada seca y 894 en la de lluvia, la mayor frecuencia de consumo se presentó con los artrópodos, principalmente Acrididae, Cicadellidae, Coleoptera y Lepidoptera; mamíferos, sobresaliendo Lepus californicus y Sylvilagus audubonii. El material vegetal, los reptiles y las aves se presentaron con una frecuencia menor. El grupo de los mamíferos aportó la mayor biomasa, con 86.47\% en la temporada seca y 72.52\% en lluvia. Se observó un mayor consumo de materia vegetal en los sitios con menor grado de modificación. Estos resultados confirman que el coyote es un depredador generalista, omnívoro y oportunista; con una fuerte tendencia a consumir artrópodos durante ambas temporadas, aunque la mayor aportación de biomasa la obtenga de los mamíferos.

Plant material, reptiles and birds were less frequently consumed items. Mammals provided the greatest biomass, 86.5\% in the dry season and 72.5\% in the rainy season. Plant material was consumed more frequently at less modified sites. These results support the idea that coyote is a generalist, omnivore and opportunist predator, with a strong tendency to consume arthropods during the whole year, although the greatest biomass is obtained from mammals.},

There is a positive significant relationship between the body masses of solitary killer species and body masses of their victim species, and grouping species kill larger victims than solitary species. Interactions and consumption of the victim appear more common when food is scarce or disputed. In response to killers, victim species may alter their use of space, activity patterns, and form groups. Consequences of interspecific killing include population reduction or even extinction, and reduction and enhancement of prey populations, and may therefore have important implications for conservation and management of carnivores and their prey.},

We coalesced data from all pertinent studies of kit and swift foxes and examined their numerical responses to changes in prey abundance. We also explored the influence of coyote-related mortalities on fox population dynamics. Fox density was positively correlated with leporid abundance, and fox reproduction rates were density-dependent at low prey densities. The proportion of the fox population killed by coyotes increased linearly over low to moderate fox densities, and survival rates of adult foxes decreased as the proportion of mortalities caused by coyotes increased. Hence, prey abundance and interference competition by coyotes may regulate fox populations.

	abstract = {Although interspecific killing among carnivores can drive populations toward extinction, it is generally unknown how these intraguild interactions vary among populations, and whether the threat for vulnerable species can be mitigated. We studied imperiled populations of swift foxes (Vulpes velox) in Canada and kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis) in Mexico to determine potential differences in survival or predator-avoidance strategies. Survival rates were significantly lower in Canada than in Mexico because of mortality caused by coyotes (Canis latrans) and golden eagles (Aquila chrysaëtos), and the potential for population recovery is likely higher for the Mexican fox population. Differences in body size between coyotes and foxes, diet, group sizes, intraspecific home-range overlap, home-range sizes of coyotes, and movements of coyotes relative to foxes were similar among study areas. However, Canadian foxes had home ranges that were approximately 3 times larger than those in Mexico, and Canadian foxes were most frequently killed on their home-range peripheries. Home ranges of kit foxes decreased in size as the availability of black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies increased and associated refuge holes, which foxes could use to escape predation, were significantly more abundant in Mexico than in Canada. Small home ranges of foxes probably reduced encounters with coyotes in Mexico, and a high availability of refuges likely allowed foxes to elude predators when such encounters did occur. Differences in survival of foxes relative to mortality caused by coyotes demonstrate that interactions between carnivores can -vary greatly between populations and that, in some situations, vulnerable species may be able to coexist with dominant carnivores despite a lack of large-scale habitat partitioning.},

In the warm, arid grassland and shrubland habitats where kit foxes occur, coyotes are more cover dependent than kit foxes, creating the possibility of habitat segregation. Effects of habitat variation on coyote and kit fox competition are unknown. We assessed exploitation and interference competition between coyotes and kit foxes in grassland and shrubland habitats to determine if such competition varies among habitats. With respect to exploitation competition, we evaluated habitat and spatial partitioning, diet, prey abundance, and survival for kit foxes and coyotes at the Lokern Natural Area in central California, USA, from January 2003 through June 2004. Kit foxes partitioned habitat, space, and diet with coyotes. Coyotes primarily used shrubland habitats whereas kit foxes selectively used burned grasslands. Kit foxes and coyotes had high dietary overlap with regards to items used, but proportional use of items differed between the 2 species. Kit foxes selected for Heermann's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys heermanni), which were closely tied to shrub habitats. With respect to interference competition, predation was the primary source of mortality for kit foxes, and survival of individual kit foxes was inversely related to proportion of shrub habitat within their home ranges. Our results suggest that a heterogeneous landscape may benefit kit foxes by providing habitat patches where predation risk may be lower.},

* 2We used spatial, seasonal and temporal heterogeneity in wolf distribution and abundance to test the hypothesis that interference competition with wolves limits the distribution and abundance of coyotes. From August 2001 to August 2004, we gathered data on cause-specific mortality and survival rates of coyotes captured at wolf-free and wolf-abundant sites in Grand Teton National Park (GTNP), Wyoming, USA, to determine whether mortality due to wolves is sufficient to reduce coyote densities. We examined whether spatial segregation limits the local distribution of coyotes by evaluating home-range overlap between resident coyotes and wolves, and by contrasting dispersal rates of transient coyotes captured in wolf-free and wolf-abundant areas. Finally, we analysed data on population densities of both species at three study areas across the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) to determine whether an inverse relationship exists between coyote and wolf densities.
* 3Although coyotes were the numerically dominant predator, across the GYE, densities varied spatially and temporally in accordance with wolf abundance. Mean coyote densities were 33\% lower at wolf-abundant sites in GTNP, and densities declined 39\% in Yellowstone National Park following wolf reintroduction.
* 4A strong negative relationship between coyote and wolf densities (β = –3·988, P {\textless} 0·005, r2 = 0·54, n = 16), both within and across study sites, supports the hypothesis that competition with wolves limits coyote populations.
* 5Overall mortality of coyotes resulting from wolf predation was low, but wolves were responsible for 56\% of transient coyote deaths (n = 5). In addition, dispersal rates of transient coyotes captured at wolf-abundant sites were 117\% higher than for transients captured in wolf-free areas.
* 6Our results support the hypothesis that coyote abundance is limited by competition with wolves, and suggest that differential effects on survival and dispersal rates of transient coyotes are important mechanisms by which wolves reduce coyote densities.},

	abstract = {Aim Coyote (Canis latrans) distribution in Mexico and Central America has expanded recently reaching the Yucatan peninsula, Belize and Panama, probably promoted by deforestation of tropical areas. Historically, the southern distribution of coyotes prior to European settlement in America was described as reaching only as far south as central Mexico and that introduction of livestock favoured migration of coyotes to southern Mexico and Central America. However, coyote fossil records in Central America and Yucatan, as well as observational records of travellers during the sixteenth century suggest that the coyote's arrival to the region was earlier. Because of the uncertainty of past coyote distribution and the possible economic and ecological impacts due to recent range expansion, the objectives of this study were to confirm if paleontological and historical evidence support the hypothesis that the southernmost limit of coyote distribution before the arrival of European settlers was the centre of Mexico, to discuss the possible factors that have influenced historical shifts in coyote distribution, and to model the present distribution of the coyote in Mexico and Central America, determining the areas where they could invade in the near future. Location The research area comprises continental Mexico and the Central American Isthmus countries: Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. Methods The historical distribution (Pleistocene-Early Holocene, Pre-Columbian, sixteenth to nineteenth centuries and twentieth century) was established from coyote records obtained from museum collections and specialized literature. Present coyote distribution for Mexico and Central America was modelled using the Genetic Algorithms for Rule-set Prediction (GARP). Results Historical coyote records show that this species was distributed in southern Mexico and Central America during the Pleistocene-Early Holocene, the Pre-Columbian period, and during the arrival of Europeans in the sixteenth century. Coyote records indicate a continuous range expansion during the twentieth century. Historical advance and regression of tropical forests in southern Mexico and Central America produced by natural and human events such as climatic changes and variation in human densities could help us understand the historical coyote distribution. The modelled present-day coyote distribution included the north of Belize, the north of Panama, the north of the Yucatan Peninsula and a corridor on the Gulf costal plain of Campeche in Mexico. Also, the model predicted a region north of the Darien in southern Panama as appropriate for the presence of coyotes, although they have not been detected there so far. Main conclusion Coyote records in southern Mexico and Central America during the Pleistocene-Early Holocene, the Pre-Columbian period, and early arrival of European settlers to the area indicated that coyotes were probably already present there and did not recently disperse from the north of Mexico to the south due to livestock introduction. /// Objetivo La distribución del coyote (Canis latrans) se ha expandido recientemente en México y Centroamérica hasta alcanzar la península de Yucatán, Belice y Panamá, probablemente favorecida por la deforestación en regiones tropicales. Históricamente se ha creído que la distribución de esta especie a la llegada de los colonizadores europeos tenía su limite sur en el centro de México y que la introducción del ganado en el sur de México y Centroamérica favoreció la migración de los coyotes hacia estas áreas. Sin embargo, registros fósiles de coyotes en Centroamérica y Yucatán, así como registros visuales de esta especie por viajeros durante el siglo XVI, sugieren que la llegada de los coyotes a la región fue anterior a lo que previamente se creía. Debido a la controversia sobre la distribución anterior del coyote, así como por los posibles impactos económicos y ecológicos que los coyotes pueden provocar por su reciente expansión, los objetivos de este estudio fueron determinar si la evidencia paleontológica e histórica apoya la hipótesis de que la distribución de esta especie antes de la llegada de los colonizadores europeos llegaba hasta el centro de México, discutir los posibles factores que han influido sobre los cambios históricos en su distribución y modelar la distribución actual del coyote en México y Centroamérica, determinando las áreas que los coyotes pueden invadir en el futuro. Área de Estudio El estudio comprendió la porción continental de México y los países del Istmo Centroamericano: Guatemala, Belice, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica y Panamá. Métodos Se estableció la distribución histórica del coyote (Pleistoceno-Holoceno temprano, Precolombina, siglos XVI al XIX y siglo XX) a partir de registros de coyotes obtenidos de colecciones científicas de museos y literatura especializada. Se modeló la distribución actual del coyote en México y Centroamérica usando algoritmos genéticos (GARP). Resultados Los registros históricos de coyote indican que la especie estuvo distribuida en el sur de México y Centroamérica durante el Pleistoceno-Holoceno temprano, la etapa Precolombina y a la llegada de los europeos en el siglo XVI. Los registros indican un incremento continuo en el área de distribución del coyote durante el siglo XX. El avance y contracción de los bosques tropicales en el sur de México y Centroamérica debido a causas naturales y humanas, tales como cambios climáticos o variación de las densidades humanas, pueden ayudar a entender la distribución histórica del coyote. La distribución actual de esta especie obtenida a través del modelo, reconoce que puede estar presente al norte de la península de Yucatán y la llanura costera del Golfo de Campeche en México, y en Centroamérica, el norte de Belice y el norte de Panamá. Además, el modelo muestra que, aún cuando la especie no ha llegado a la región norte de Darién en el sur de Panamá, dicho lugar es apropiado para ser invadido por los coyotes. Conclusiones Principales Los registros de coyotes en el sur de México y Centroamérica en el Pleistoceno-Holoceno temprano, la época Precolombina y durante las primeras etapas de la Colonia Española indican que los coyotes probablemente ya estaban presentes en el área a la llegada de los colonizadores europeos, y no se dispersaron recientemente hacia el sur de México y Centroamérica desde el centro de México con la introducción de la ganadería en el área.},

	abstract = {Interspecific competition among canids can result in mortalities and spatial displacement of smaller canids by larger canids. To investigate mortalities and spatial relationships of swift foxes (Vulpes velox) and coyotes (Canis latrans), we captured and radio-tracked both species at Rita Blanca National Grasslands in northwestern Texas. At least 89\% of swift fox mortalities were caused by coyotes, resulting in a relatively low annual survival of 0.47 for swift foxes. Annual home ranges of swift foxes occurred near the periphery and outside coyote home ranges, and did not overlap or only slightly overlapped coyote core areas. Thirty-three of 36 known swift fox dens occurred outside coyote core areas. When swift foxes established dens within coyote core areas (n = 3), they were killed by coyotes shortly thereafter. Our data indicated that spatial displacement of swift foxes was not due to behavioral avoidance of coyotes but rather to increased killing of swift foxes within coyote core areas.

Pour étudier la mortalité et les relations spatiales des renards véloces (Vulpes velox) et des coyotes (Canis latrans), nous avons suivi et capturé des animaux des deux espèces dans les Rita Bianca National Grasslands, dans le nord-ouest du Texas. Au moins 89 \% des mortalités chez les renards étaient attribuables aux coyotes, ce qui donnait lieu à un taux annuel de survie relativement faible de 0,47. Les domaines annuels des renards véloces se trouvaient en périphérie, en dehors des domaines des coyotes et ils ne chevauchaient pas la partie centrale des domaines des coyotes, ou alors très peu. Trente-trois des 36 terriers connus des renards se trouvaient en dehors de la partie centrale des domaines des coyotes.

We conducted a meta-analysis of 7,929 photographs from 217 localities in 11 camera-trap studies across coastal southern California to describe habitat use and determine the effects of urban proximity (distance to urban edge) and intensity (percentage of area urbanized) on carnivore occurrence and species richness in natural habitats close to the urban boundary. Coyotes (Canis latrans) and bobcats (Lynx rufus) were distributed widely across the region. Domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), raccoons (Procyon lotor), gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), mountain lions (Puma concolor), and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana) were detected less frequently, and long-tailed weasels (Mustela frenata), American badgers (Taxidea taxus), western spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis), and domestic cats (Felis catus) were detected rarely. Habitat use generally reflected availability for most species. Coyote and raccoon occurrence increased with both proximity to and intensity of urbanization, whereas bobcat, gray fox, and mountain lion occurrence decreased with urban proximity and intensity. Domestic dogs and Virginia opossums exhibited positive and weak negative relationships, respectively, with urban intensity but were unaffected by urban proximity. Striped skunk occurrence increased with urban proximity but decreased with urban intensity. Native species richness was negatively associated with urban intensity but not urban proximity, probably because of the stronger negative response of individual species to urban intensity.},

	abstract = {Recovery of large carnivores remains a challenge because complex spatial dynamics that facilitate population persistence are poorly understood. In particular, recovery of the critically endangered red wolf (Canis rufus) has been challenging because of its vulnerability to extinction via human-caused mortality and hybridization with coyotes (Canis latrans). Therefore, understanding red wolf space use and habitat selection is important to assist recovery because key aspects of wolf ecology such as interspecific competition, foraging, and habitat selection are well-known to influence population dynamics and persistence. During 2009–2011, we used global positioning system (GPS) radio-telemetry to quantify space use and 3rd-order habitat selection for resident and transient red wolves on the Albemarle Peninsula of eastern North Carolina. The Albemarle Peninsula was a predominantly agricultural landscape in which red wolves maintained spatially stable home ranges that varied between 25 km2 and 190 km2. Conversely, transient red wolves did not maintain home ranges and traversed areas between 122 km2 and 681 km2. Space use by transient red wolves was not spatially stable and exhibited shifting patterns until residency was achieved by individual wolves. Habitat selection was similar between resident and transient red wolves in which agricultural habitats were selected over forested habitats. However, transients showed stronger selection for edges and roads than resident red wolves. Behaviors of transient wolves are rarely reported in studies of space use and habitat selection because of technological limitations to observed extensive space use and because they do not contribute reproductively to populations. Transients in our study comprised displaced red wolves and younger dispersers that competed for limited space and mating opportunities. Therefore, our results suggest that transiency is likely an important life-history strategy for red wolves that facilitates metapopulation dynamics through short- and long-distance movements and eventual replacement of breeding residents lost to mortality.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Despite the importance of carnivores in terrestrial ecosystems, many nations have implemented well-coordinated, state-funded initiatives to remove predators, largely because of conflicts with humans over livestock. Although these control efforts have been successful in terms of the number of carnivores removed, their effects on the viability of the industries they seek to protect are less understood. I assessed the efficacy of long-term efforts by the U.S. government to improve the viability of the sheep industry by reducing predation losses. I used regression analysis and hierarchical partitioning of a 60-year data set to explore associations among changes in sheep numbers and factors such as predator control effort, market prices, and production costs. In addition, I compared trends in the sheep industry in the western United States, where predator control is subsidized and coyotes (Canis latrans) are abundant, with trends in eastern states that lack federally subsidized predator control and that were (1) colonized by coyotes before 1950 or (2) colonized by coyotes between 1950 and 1990. Although control efforts were positively correlated with fluctuations in sheep numbers, production costs and market prices explained most of the model variation, with a combined independent contribution of 77\%. Trends in sheep numbers in eastern and western states were highly correlated (r ≥0.942) independent of the period during which they were colonized by coyotes, indicating either that control has been ineffective at reducing predation losses or that factors other than predation account for the declines in both regions. These results suggest that government-subsidized predator control has failed to prevent the decline in the sheep industry and alternative support mechanisms need to be developed if the goal is to increase sheep production and not simply to kill carnivores.},

Previous genetic analysis of other arid-land fox populations in the U.S. showed that the species is divided into two phylogenetically distinct taxa; the kit fox occupies the western, and the swift fox, the eastern plains bordering the Rocky Mountains. We analyzed 740 base pairs (bp) of cytochrome b sequence and 350 bp of control region sequence to determine if Mexican kit foxes are genetically distinct and to assess their relationship to kit and swift foxes of the U.S. We found two genotypes in 19 foxes from Nuevo Le6n and Coahuila, Mexico that differed by a single base pair substitution. These genotypes were phylogenetically grouped with those sequences from kit foxes in Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico but differed from them by 1 to 4 substitutions (0.3 to 1.3\%) in control region sequence. Our results suggest that the Mexican kit foxes are closely associated with populations of the kit fox to the west of the Rocky Mountains and, although they have unique genotypes, Mexican kit foxes have only recently been isolated from their conspecifics in the U.S. /// La zorra norteña (Vulpes macrotis zinseri) es una subespecie en peligro de extinción que se encuentra restringida a las praderas áridas de la Sierra Madre en México.

Para determinar si la zorra norteña es genéticamente distinta y para evaluar las relaciones filogenéticas que estos zorros tienen con los de las especies V macrotis y V velox de los Estados Unidos, analizamos las secuencias de dos regiones del ADN mitocondrial: 740 pares de bases del citocromo b y 350 pares de bases de la región control.

	abstract = {Determining the factors that influence or limit the distribution of endangered species can have important conservation implications. We investigated the spatial distribution of endangered San Joaquin kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis mutica) within a 31,400-ha area of the Naval Petroleum Reserves in California (NPRC) from 1988 to 1995 by relating capture rates of kit foxes to habitat factors, visitation rates of larger predators, and prey counts. Capture rates also were related to habitat factors on a smaller portion (11,500 ha) of NPRC from 1981 to 1995. Kit foxes were relatively evenly distributed in 1981-82, and regression models consequently explained only 6\% of the spatial variation in capture rates. Afterwards, the distribution of kit foxes became more restricted, and models explained 36-60\% of the variation in rates of capture. Capture rates were negatively associated with topographic ruggedness, were lower within a fenced area (limited public access and no livestock grazing; P {\textless} 0.001), and were often higher within burned areas (P {\textless} 0.001). After 1987, capture rates were usually negatively associated with oil-field development. Visitation rates of coyotes (Canis latrans), a major predator of kit foxes, were higher within the fenced area (P ≤ 0.034). Capture rates were negatively correlated (\$r\_\{132\}\$ = -0.22, P = 0.01) with coyote visitation rates during 1992-95. Locations of bobcat (Lynx rufus) captures and visits to scent stations overlapped very little with capture locations of kit foxes. Counts of lagomorphs (a significant prey item) were negatively associated with burning, and between 1992 and 1995, lagomorph counts were positively associated with oil-field development. Capture rates were not correlated with lagomorph counts during 1988-91 (\$r\_\{77\}\$ = -0.09, P = 0.44) or 1992-95 (\$r\_\{77\}\$ = 0.15, P = 0.18). Our findings indicated the relation between kit foxes and the habitat factors studied was somewhat flexible, and the spatial distribution of kit foxes was not determined primarily by prey abundance. Predator density and topographic ruggedness appear to be important underlying factors governing the spatial distribution of kit foxes at NPRC.},

	abstract = {* 1Over the last 30 years there has been a great deal of interest in investigating patterns of species co-occurrence across a number of locations, which has led to the development of numerous methods to determine whether there is evidence that a particular pattern may not have occurred by random chance.
* 2A key aspect that seems to have been largely overlooked is the possibility that species may not always be detected at a location when present, which leads to ‘false absences’ in a species presence/absence matrix that may cause incorrect inferences to be made about co-occurrence patterns. Furthermore, many of the published methods for investigating patterns of species co-occurrence do not account for potential differences in the site characteristics that may partially (at least) explain non-random patterns (e.g. due to species having similar/different habitat preferences).
* 3Here we present a statistical method for modelling co-occurrence patterns between species while accounting for imperfect detection and site characteristics. This method requires that multiple presence/absence surveys for the species be conducted over a reasonably short period of time at most sites. The method yields unbiased estimates of probabilities of occurrence, and is practical when the number of species is small ({\textless} 4).
* 4To illustrate the method we consider data collected on two terrestrial salamander species, Plethodon jordani and members of the Plethodon glutinosus complex, collected in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA. We find no evidence that the species do not occur independently at sites once site elevation has been allowed for, although we find some evidence of a statistical interaction between species in terms of detectability that we suggest may be due to changes in relative abundances.},

We present a new parameterization that is stable when covariates are included: the conditional two-species occupancy model, which can be used to examine alternative hypotheses for species' distribution patterns. This new model estimates the probability of occupancy for a subordinate species conditional upon the presence of a dominant species. It can also be used to test if the detection of either species differs when one or both species are present, and if detection of the subordinate species depends on the detection of the dominant species when both are present. We apply the model to test if the presence of the larger Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola) affects probabilities of detection or occupancy of the smaller California Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus) in small freshwater marshes that range in size from 0.013 to 13.99 ha. We hypothesized that Black Rail occupancy should be lower in small marshes when Virginia Rails are present than when they are absent, because resources are presumably more limited and interference competition should increase. We found that Black Rail detection probability was unaffected by the detection of Virginia Rails, while, surprisingly, Black and Virginia Rail occupancy were positively associated even in small marshes. The average probability of Black Rail occupancy was higher when Virginia Rails were present (0.74 ± 0.053, mean ± SE) than when they were absent (0.36 ± 0.069), and for both species occupancy increased with marsh size. Our results contrast with recent findings from patchy forest systems, where small birds were presumed to be excluded from small habitat patches by larger competitors.},

Therefore, it is important to understand properties of the point process distribution. We examine how the hierarchical species distribution modeling framework has been used to incorporate a wide array of regression and theory-based components while accounting for the data collection process and making use of auxiliary information. The hierarchical modeling framework allows us to demonstrate how several commonly used species distribution models can be derived from the point process distribution, highlight areas of potential overlap between different models, and suggest areas where further research is needed.},

	abstract = {* Two main sources of data for species distribution models (SDMs) are site-occupancy (SO) data from planned surveys, and presence-background (PB) data from opportunistic surveys and other sources. SO surveys give high quality data about presences and absences of the species in a particular area. However, due to their high cost, they often cover a smaller area relative to PB data, and are usually not representative of the geographic range of a species. In contrast, PB data is plentiful, covers a larger area, but is less reliable due to the lack of information on species absences, and is usually characterised by biased sampling. Here we present a new approach for species distribution modelling that integrates these two data types.


* We have used an inhomogeneous Poisson point process as the basis for constructing an integrated SDM that fits both PB and SO data simultaneously. It is the first implementation of an Integrated SO–PB Model which uses repeated survey occupancy data and also incorporates detection probability.


* The Integrated Model's performance was evaluated, using simulated data and compared to approaches using PB or SO data alone. It was found to be superior, improving the predictions of species spatial distributions, even when SO data is sparse and collected in a limited area. The Integrated Model was also found effective when environmental covariates were significantly correlated. Our method was demonstrated with real SO and PB data for the Yellow-bellied glider (Petaurus australis) in south-eastern Australia, with the predictive performance of the Integrated Model again found to be superior.


* PB models are known to produce biased estimates of species occupancy or abundance. The small sample size of SO datasets often results in poor out-of-sample predictions. Integrated models combine data from these two sources, providing superior predictions of species abundance compared to using either data source alone. Unlike conventional SDMs which have restrictive scale-dependence in their predictions, our Integrated Model is based on a point process model and has no such scale-dependency. It may be used for predictions of abundance at any spatial-scale while still maintaining the underlying relationship between abundance and area.},

	abstract = {Aim

During the past decade ecologists have attempted to estimate the parameters of species distribution models by combining locations of species presence observed in opportunistic surveys with spatially referenced covariates of occurrence. Several statistical models have been proposed for the analysis of presence-only data, but these models have largely ignored the effects of imperfect detection and survey bias. In this paper I describe a model-based approach for the analysis of presence-only data that accounts for errors in the detection of individuals and for biased selection of survey locations.


Innovation

I develop a hierarchical, statistical model that allows presence-only data to be analysed in conjunction with data acquired independently in planned surveys. One component of the model specifies the spatial distribution of individuals within a bounded, geographic region as a realization of a spatial point process. A second component of the model specifies two kinds of observations, the detection of individuals encountered during opportunistic surveys and the detection of individuals encountered during planned surveys.


Main conclusions

Using mathematical proof and simulation-based comparisons, I demonstrate that biases induced by errors in detection or biased selection of survey locations can be reduced or eliminated by using the hierarchical model to analyse presence-only data in conjunction with counts observed in planned surveys. I show that a relatively small number of high-quality data (from planned surveys) can be used to leverage the information in presence-only observations, which usually have broad spatial coverage but may not be informative of both occurrence and detectability of individuals. Because a variety of sampling protocols can be used in planned surveys, this approach to the analysis of presence-only data is widely applicable. In addition, since the point-process model is formulated at the level of an individual, it can be extended to account for biological interactions between individuals and temporal changes in their spatial distributions.},

Because these areas are small and intensively used, they can affect the total distances covered by animals searching for resources. Our objective was to document which habitat variables affect core area selection by female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in an arid environment, and to learn which variables affect their displacement within these areas. Using radiotelemetry, from 2012 to 2014 we monitored seven female mule deer. We estimated their core areas, and with this information we identified and classified the location records as inside or outside of the core area. For each record, we also recorded variables related to time (month, time of day), environmental conditions (temperature, relative humidity), and habitat characteristics (plant association, distance to the nearest water body, slope), and used them to predict the presence of the deer in the core area using Classification and Regression Trees (CART). The same variables were analyzed using a GLM to determine which factors explain variations in displacement distance. The most important variable in core area selection was the distance to the nearest body of water ({\textless}933.71m at the population level and {\textless}1375.11m on average for individual deer), followed by two plant associations that included the dominant species Prosopis glandulosa, Pleuraphis mutica, Larrea tridentata, Opuntia rastrera and Fouquieria splendens in areas with a gentle slope or none. Displacement distances within the core area were shorter than those outside and were affected by time of day and month. Our results are the first to elucidate the use of the core area by female mule deer in the Chihuahuan Desert, and allow us to start understanding the connection between the habitat resources essential to the survival of these deer and their movement under desert conditions.},

We develop an abstraction of the predation process in which several components of predation risk are identified. A review of the literature indicates that an animal's ability to assess and behaviorally control one or more of these components strongly influences decision making in feeding animals, as well as in animals deciding when and how to escape predators, when and how to be social, or even, for fishes, when and how to breathe air. This review also reveals that such decision making reflects apparent trade-offs between the risk of predation and the benefits to be gained from engaging in a given activity. Despite thi...},

	abstract = {Mammalian predator-prey systems are behaviorally sophisticated games of stealth and fear. But, traditional mass-action models of predator prey dynamics treat individuals as behaviorally unresponsive "molecules" in Brownian motion. Foraging theory should provide the conceptual framework to envision the interaction. But, current models of predator feeding behavior generally envision a clever predator consuming large numbers of sessile and behaviorally inert prey (e. g., kangaroo rats, Dipodomys, collecting seeds from food patches). Here, we extend foraging theory to consider a predator-prey game of stealth and fear and then embed this game into the modeling of predator-prey population dynamics. The melding of the prey and predator's optimal behaviors with their population and community-level consequences constitutes the ecology of fear. The ecology of fear identifies the endpoints of a continuum of N-driven (population size) versus μ-driven (fear) systems. In N-driven systems, the major direct dynamical feedback involves predators killing prey, whereas μ-driven systems involve the indirect effects from changes in fear levels and prey catchability. In μ-driven systems, prey respond to predators by becoming more vigilant or by moving away from suspected predators. In this way, a predator (e. g., mountain lion, Puma concolor) depletes a food patch (e. g., local herd of mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus) by frightening prey rather than by actually killing prey. Behavior buffers the system: a reduction in predator numbers should rapidly engender less vigilant and more catchable prey. The ecology of fear explains why big fierce carnivores should be and can be rare. In carnivore systems, ignore the behavioral game at one's peril.},

Field and laboratory studies show that predator odors have distinctive behavioral effects which include (1) inhibition of activity, (2) suppression of non-defensive behaviors such as foraging, feeding and grooming, and (3) shifts to habitats or secure locations where such odors are not present. The repellent effect of predator odors in the field may sometimes be of practical use in the protection of crops and natural resources, although not all attempts at this have been successful. The failure of some studies to obtain repellent effects with predator odors may relate to (1) mismatches between the predator odors and prey species employed, (2) strain and individual differences in sensitivity to predator odors, and (3) the use of predator odors that have low efficacy. In this regard, a small number of recent studies have suggested that skin and fur-derived predator odors may have a more profound lasting effect on prey species than those derived from urine or feces. Predator odors can have powerful effects on the endocrine system including a suppression of testosterone and increased levels of stress hormones such as corticosterone and ACTH. Inhibitory effects of predator odors on reproductive behavior have been demonstrated, and these are particularly prevalent in female rodent species. Pregnant female rodents exposed to predator odors may give birth to smaller litters while exposure to predator odors during early life can hinder normal development. Recent research is starting to uncover the neural circuitry activated by predator odors, leading to hypotheses about how such activation leads to observable effects on reproduction, foraging and feeding.},

In two-choice control tests, subjects indiscriminately consumed apple from unscented bowls and from bowls scented with urine from an unfamiliar herbivore (Cavia porcellus), or with butyric acid. During two-choice tests offering apple from bowls scented with secretion from anal glands of minks and from bowls scented with butyric acid, significantly less apple was consumed from bowls containing mink scent. In two-choice tests in which apple was offered from bowls scented with urine from either mink, bobcat, coyote, or domestic dog, all predator urines reduced feeding. Habituation was studied by measuring consumption of dry pellets during continuous exposure to coyote urine for 5 days. Significantly less chow was consumed from bowls scented with coyote urine than from control bowls, indicating a lack of habituation to the predator scent. We conclude that predator scents act as natural repellents. The responsiveness to scents from several sympatric predators as well as from domestic dogs suggest an innate reaction to a signal, which is common to carnivores. The utility of predator scents in the control of browsing damage by mountain beavers should be explored.},

Unlike other signal modalities, olfactory signals cannot be ‘switched off’ in the presence of an eavesdropping predator, leaving receivers of scent signals at an increased risk of predation long after the signaller has moved on. Yet individuals of some olfactorily communicating species appear unwilling to forego the receiving of signals under an increased risk of predation. Foraging theory predicts that predation risk can operate at multiple spatial scales, however, such that prey behaviour should be sensitive to the broader olfactory environment beyond the risks of a single point source of odour.},

	abstract = {Understanding the conditions that facilitate top predator effects upon mesopredators and prey is critical for predicting where these effects will be significant. Intraguild predation (IGP) and the ecology of fear are hypotheses used to describe the effects of top predators upon mesopredators and prey species, but make different assumptions about organismal space use. The IGP hypothesis predicts that mesopredator resource acquisition and risk are positively correlated, creating a fitness deficit. But if shared prey also avoid a top predator, then mesopredators may not have to choose between risk and reward. Prey life history may be a critical predictor of how shared prey respond to predation and may mediate mesopredator suppression. We used hierarchical models of species distribution and abundance to test expectations of IGP using two separate triangular relationships between a large carnivore, smaller intraguild carnivore, and shared mammalian prey with different life histories. Following IGP, we expected that a larger carnivore would suppress a smaller carnivore if the shared prey species did not spatially avoid the large carnivore at broad scales. If prey were fearful over broad scales, we expected less evidence of mesopredator suppression. We tested these theoretical hypotheses using remote camera detections across a large spatial extent. Lagomorphs did not appear to avoid coyotes, and fox detection probability was lower as coyote abundance increased. In contrast, white‐tailed deer appeared to avoid areas of increased wolf use, and coyote detection probability was not reduced at sites where wolves occurred. These findings suggest that mesopredator suppression by larger carnivores may depend upon the behavior of shared prey, specifically the spatial scale at which they perceive risk. We further discuss how extrinsic environmental factors may contribute to mesopredator suppression.},

The species varied greatly in population density, extent of interannual variation in abundance, timing of reproduction, extent to which reproduction was seasonal, rate of disappearance of marked individuals, frequency and distance of lifetime dispersal movements, but perhaps less so in death rate and maximum longevity. Most of the species showed positively correlated year-to-year fluctuations in population density, suggesting that they responded similarly to interannual variation in precipitation, primary production, and availability of food resources. In contrast, there were both positive and negative correlations in seasonal patterns of reproductive activity and population density. Lifetime dispersal movements were inversely related to body size, suggesting that energy constraints cause the smallest species to move among rich patches in a coarse-grained manner. Patterns of similarities and differences among closely related (congeneric and confamilial) species suggested that evolutionary constraints sometimes, but not always, limited variation in life history and demography. The relationship between population ecology and competition among these species was not clear. We interpret the diversity of life histories and population dynamics in these coexisting species to be a consequence of: (a) a productive and spatially and temporally variable environment that provides a variety of resources that may be used in different ways, (b) historical biogeographic events that have made available a large regional pool of species from which potential colonists can be drawn, and (c) differences in population ecologies among the species that evolved primarily in other environmental contexts, but that permit coexistence by enabling the species to use different resources or to use the same resources in different ways.},

We extracted information on survival and fecundity from an 18-month, live-trapping study of Dipodomys stephensi, and from this we developed an age-structured demographic model to assess population viability. Adult Stephens' kangaroo rats persisted longer than juveniles, and adult females persisted longer than adult males. Disappearance rates were high in the first months after initial capture. Thereafter, the fraction of animals persisting decreased slowly and in an approximately linear fashion on a semilogarithmic scale, suggesting age-independent mortality factors such as predation. Juvenile persistence did not differ substantially between two years of strikingly different rainfall. Onset of breeding followed the start of winter rains. Length of the breeding season, average number of litters per female, and the fraction of first-year females breeding were much greater in the year of higher rainfall. We propose a birth-pulse demographic model for D. stephensi that distinguishes juvenile and adult age classes. Temporal environmental variation can be modeled adequately with a constant survivorship schedule and variable fecundity determined by yearly precipitation. Several issues should be resolved, however, before conservation decisions are based on the model. Better estimates of juvenile survivorship are critical, the quantitative relationship between precipitation and fecundity must be determined, and the potential for density dependence and source-sink population dynamics must be evaluated.},

We analyzed the variation in surface microhabitat with relation to the burrow occupancy for this tortoise at the Mapimí Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. In summer 2010, we monitored burrow activity (active, inactive, or abandoned) and measured environmental factors that might influence the burrow's occupancy by tortoises (air temperature, relative humidity and substrate temperature, both inside and outside the burrow, and the plant cover around it). Discriminant analysis was used to identify the importance of these variables influencing burrow occupancy. Correlation and linear regression analyses were performed to quantify the relation between environmental factors in the sampled burrows. Results. Sixty-one burrows were identified at the Tortugas locality. The first function's auto-value analysis indicates that this function explains 97.9\% of the variation in burrow activity status; high occupancy scores were associated with low substrate temperature inside the burrow. Plant cover was inversely proportional to substrate temperature inside the burrow. These results suggest the importance the density of plants surrounding the tortoise's burrow as a key factor influencing the burrow microclimate and occupancy by the tortoises. Conclusions. Gopherus flavomarginatus inhabits burrows, in part, based on microhabitat structure, with plant cover being a main factor influencing burrow occupancy. Our findings indicate that human land use and vegetation management are important for conserving Bolson tortoises, and for understanding habitat conditions necessary for the successful establishment of populations elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Predator odors are non-intrusive natural stressors of high ethological relevance. Animals are daily challenged with stressors of varying intensity and it is essential for their survival to respond to a wide range of threats. Behavioral and hormonal responses and changes in the level of medial hypothalamic c-fos mRNA were examined in Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) exposed to the feces of a domestic cat (Felis catus) stored for different periods. One hundred voles were tested in the defensive withdrawal apparatus. The voles showed an aversion to freshly collected cat feces, indicated by high levels of flight-related behaviors, increased freezing behavior, and more vigilant rearing compared to old feces. The serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone significantly increased when the voles were exposed to fresh cat feces. The level of c-fos mRNA in the medial hypothalamic region was highest in the individuals exposed to fresh cat feces. All of these behavioral, endocrine and c-fos-mRNA responses were lower when voles were subjected to older cat feces. We conclude that these responses depend on volatile chemical constituents of cat feces rather than their physical characteristics and that this accounts for the lower responses to feces stored for longer periods.},

	abstract = {The advantages of using predator-related odor stimuli to study emotional responses in laboratory tests depend on whether such stimuli do elicit a relatively complete pattern of emotionality. This has been confirmed for cat fur/skin odor stimuli, which elicit a range of defensive behaviors in rats that may be reduced by anxiolytic drugs, produce residual anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and support rapid aversive conditioning to the context in which they were encountered. Although the synthetic fox fecal odor, trimethylthiazoline (TMT), elicits avoidance similar to that seen in response to cat fur/skin odor, this avoidance does not respond to anxiolytic drugs. In addition, TMT does not produce residual anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze, nor does it support conditioning. As natural cat feces also elicit avoidance but fail to support conditioning, it is possible that the ability of a predator-related odor to serve as an effective unconditioned stimulus (US) relates to its predictive status with reference to the actual presence of the predator. Avoidance per se may reflect that a stimulus is aversive but not necessarily capable of eliciting an emotional response. This view is consonant with findings in a Mouse Defense Test Battery (MDTB) measuring a wide range of defensive responses to predator exposure. A contextual defense measure that may reflect either conditioned or residual but unconditioned emotional responses was almost never reduced by drug effects unless these also reduced risk assessment or defensive threat/attack measures. However, reductions in contextual defense without changes in flight/avoidance measures were much more common. These findings suggest that flight/avoidance, although it obviously may occur as one component of a full pattern of defensive and emotional behaviors, is also somewhat separable from the others. When—as appears to be the case with TMT—it is the major or perhaps only consistent defensive behavior elicited, this may reflect a stimulus that is aversive or noxious but with little ability to predict the presence of threat or danger. That such stimuli fail to support rapid aversive conditioning suggests the need for a reanalysis of the characteristics required for an effective aversive US.},

Giving-up densities from artificial food patches were used to quantify perceived predation risk. White-footed Mice exhibited a strong preference for cover microhabitat and for the new moon stage. However, the mice did not significantly alter their foraging behavior in response to the predator urines compared to a water control. Additionally, mice foraged less on colder nights. The results suggest that mammalian predator urines may not provide reliable information on actual predation risk for the White-footed Mice and that the mice extensively use indirect cues to assess predation risk.},

	abstract = {Summary Species occurrence is influenced by environmental conditions and the presence of other species. Current approaches for multispecies occupancy modelling are practically limited to two interacting species and often require the assumption of asymmetric interactions. We propose a multispecies occupancy model that can accommodate two or more interacting species. We generalize the single-species occupancy model to two or more interacting species by assuming the latent occupancy state is a multivariate Bernoulli random variable. We propose modelling the probability of each potential latent occupancy state with both a multinomial logit and a multinomial probit model and present details of a Gibbs sampler for the latter. As an example, we model co-occurrence probabilities of bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), grey fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as a function of human disturbance variables throughout 6 Mid-Atlantic states in the eastern United States. We found evidence for pairwise interactions among most species, and the probability of some pairs of species occupying the same site varied along environmental gradients; for example, occupancy probabilities of coyote and grey fox were independent at sites with little human disturbance, but these two species were more likely to occur together at sites with high human disturbance. Ecological communities are composed of multiple interacting species. Our proposed method improves our ability to draw inference from such communities by permitting modelling of detection/non-detection data from an arbitrary number of species, without assuming asymmetric interactions. Additionally, our proposed method permits modelling the probability two or more species occur together as a function of environmental variables. These advancements represent an important improvement in our ability to draw community-level inference from multiple interacting species that are subject to imperfect detection.},

We collected camera-trap data over three years in ten study sites covering 5,070 km2. We used multispecies occupancy modelling to assess spatial responses in varying environmental and prey conditions and competitor presence, and examined temporal overlap and the relationship between lion and leopard densities across sites and years. 4.Results showed that both lion and leopard occupancy was independent of ? rather than conditional on ? their competitor's presence across all environmental covariates. Marginal occupancy probability for leopard was higher in areas with more bushy, ?hideable? habitat, human (tourist) activity and topographic ruggedness, whereas lion occupancy decreased with increasing hideable habitat and increased with higher abundance of very large prey. Temporal overlap was high between carnivores and there was no detectable relationship between species densities. 5.Lions pose a threat to the survival of individual leopards, but they exerted no tractable influence on leopard spatial or temporal dynamics. Furthermore, lions did not appear to suppress leopard populations, suggesting that intraguild competitors can coexist in the same areas without population decline. Aligned conservation strategies that promote functioning ecosystems, rather than target individual species, are therefore advised to achieve cost- and space-effective conservation.

	abstract = {Determining how species coexist is critical for understanding functional diversity, niche partitioning and interspecific interactions. Identifying the direct and indirect interactions among sympatric carnivores that enable their coexistence is particularly important to elucidate because they are integral for maintaining ecosystem function. We studied the effects of removing nine fishers (Pekania pennanti) on their population dynamics and used this perturbation to elucidate the interspecific interactions among fishers, grey foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and ringtails (Bassariscus astutus). Grey foxes (family: Canidae) are likely to compete with fishers due to their similar body sizes and dietary overlap, and ringtails (family: Procyonidae), like fishers, are semi-arboreal species of conservation concern. We used spatial capture–recapture to investigate fisher population numbers and dynamic occupancy models that incorporated interspecific interactions to investigate the effects members of these species had on the colonization and persistence of each other's site occupancy. The fisher population showed no change in density for up to 3 years following the removals of fishers for translocations. In contrast, fisher site occupancy decreased in the years immediately following the translocations. During this same time period, site occupancy by grey foxes increased and remained elevated through the end of the study. We found a complicated hierarchy among fishers, foxes and ringtails. Fishers affected grey fox site persistence negatively but had a positive effect on their colonization. Foxes had a positive effect on ringtail site colonization. Thus, fishers were the dominant small carnivore where present and negatively affected foxes directly and ringtails indirectly. Coexistence among the small carnivores we studied appears to reflect dynamic spatial partitioning. Conservation and management efforts should investigate how intraguild interactions may influence the recolonization of carnivores to previously occupied landscapes.},

To better understand how carnivore communities are structured, we analysed camera trap data for 108 087 trap days across 12 countries spanning five continents. We estimate local probabilities of co-occurrence among 768 species pairs from the order Carnivora and evaluate how shared ecological traits correlate with probabilities of co-occurrence. Within individual study areas, species pairs co-occurred more frequently than expected at random. Co-occurrence probabilities were greatest for species pairs that shared ecological traits including similar body size, temporal activity pattern and diet. However, co-occurrence decreased as compared to other species pairs when the pair included a large-bodied carnivore.

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates. They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reﬂect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is inﬂuenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

	abstract = {1 Presence-only data, for which there is no information on locations where the species is absent, are common in both animal and plant studies. In many situations, these may be the only data available on a species. We need effective ways to use these data to explore species distribution or species use of habitat. 2 Many analytical approaches have been used to model presence-only data, some inappropriately. We provide a synthesis and critique of statistical methods currently in use to both estimate and evaluate these models, and discuss the critical importance of study design in models where only presence can be identified 3 Profile or envelope methods exist to characterize environmental covariates that describe the locations where organisms are found. Predictions from profile approaches are generally coarse, but may be useful when species records, environmental predictors and biological understanding are scarce. 4 Alternatively, one can build models to contrast environmental attributes associated with known locations with a sample of random landscape locations, termed either ‘pseudo-absences’ or ‘available’. Great care needs to be taken when selecting random landscape locations, because the way in which they are selected determines the modelling techniques that can be applied. 5 Regression-based models can provide predictions of the relative likelihood of occurrence, and in some situations predictions of the probability of occurrence. The logistic model is frequently applied, but can rarely be used directly to estimate these models; instead, case–control or logistic discrimination should be used depending on the sample design. 6 Cross-validation can be used to evaluate model performance and to assess how effectively the model reflects a quantity proportional to the probability of occurrence. However, more research is needed to develop a single measure or statistic that summarizes model performance for presence-only data. 7 Synthesis and applications. A number of statistical procedures are available to explore patterns in presence-only data; the choice among them depends on the quality of the presence-only data. Presence-only records can provide insight into the vulnerability, historical distribution and conservation status of species. Models developed using these data can inform management. Our caveat is that researchers must be mindful of study design and the biases inherent in presence data, and be cautious in the interpretation of model predictions.},

	abstract = {Presence-only data, point locations where a species has been recorded as being present, are often used in modeling the distribution of a species as a function of a set of explanatory variables---whether to map species occurrence, to understand its association with the environment, or to predict its response to environmental change. Currently, ecologists most commonly analyze presence-only data by adding randomly chosen "pseudo-absences" to the data such that it can be analyzed using logistic regression, an approach which has weaknesses in model specification, in interpretation, and in implementation. To address these issues, we propose Poisson point process modeling of the intensity of presences. We also derive a link between the proposed approach and logistic regression---specifically, we show that as the number of pseudo-absences increases (in a regular or uniform random arrangement), logistic regression slope parameters and their standard errors converge to those of the corresponding Poisson point process model. We discuss the practical implications of these results. In particular, point process modeling offers a framework for choice of the number and location of pseudo-absences, both of which are currently chosen by ad hoc and sometimes ineffective methods in ecology, a point which we illustrate by example.},

	abstract = {Aim We test a new species distribution modelling (SDM) framework, while comparing results to more common distribution modelling techniques. This framework allows for the combination of presence-only (PO) and presence-absence (PA) data and accounts for imperfect detection and spatial bias in presence data. The new framework tested here is based on a Poisson point process model, which allows for predictions of population size. We compared these estimates to those provided by experts on the species. Species and Location Presence data on Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii) throughout its range from southern México to northern Colombia were used in this research, primarily from the years 2000 to 2016. Methods Four SDM frameworks are compared as follows: (1) Maxent, (2) a presence-only (PO) SDM based on a Poisson point process model (PPM), (3) a presence-absence (PA) SDM also based on a PPM and (4) an Integrated framework which combines the previous two models. Model averaging was used to produce a single set of coefficient estimates and predictive maps for each model framework. A hotspot analysis (Gi*) was used to identify habitat cores from the predicted intensity of the Integrated model framework. Results Important variables to model the distribution of Baird's tapir included land cover, human pressure and topography. Accounting for spatial bias in the presence data affected which variables were important in the model. Maxent and the Integrated model produced predictive maps with similar patterns and were considered to be more in agreement with expert knowledge compared to the PO and PA models. Main conclusions Total abundance as predicted by the model was higher than expert opinion on the species, but local density estimates from our model were similar to available independent assessments. We suggest that these results warrant further validation and testing through collection of independent test data, development of more precise predictor layers and improvements to the model framework.},

To do this, we compared movements and home ranges of kit foxes from June 1984 to September 1985 in areas developed for petroleum production (30\% of native habitat lost to production facilities) and areas with little development (3\%). Distances traveled nightly by kit foxes did not differ between levels of petroleum development or between sexes (P {\textgreater} 0.2). Mean length of nightly movements during breeding (14.6 km) was longer than during pup-rearing (10.7 km) and pup-dispersal (9.4 km) periods (P = 0.01). Mean size of home ranges was 4.6 ± 0.4 (sx–) km2 (n = 21) and did not differ between levels of petroleum development and sexes (P {\textgreater} 0.2). Overlap of home ranges of foxes from the same social group (78 ± 4.3\%) was greater than that of same-sex foxes (35 ± 7.8\%) and males and females of different social groups (32 ± 8.0\%, P {\textless} 0.01). Overlap of home ranges did not differ between kit foxes inhabiting developed and undeveloped areas (P {\textgreater} 0.4). Despite extensive overlap of home ranges, kit foxes on NPRC maintained relatively exclusive core areas, particularly adjacent foxes of the same sex.

	abstract = {Small felids influence ecosystem dynamics through prey and plant population changes. Although most of these species are threatened, they are accorded one of the lowest research efforts of all felids, and we lack basic information about them. Many felids occur in sympatry, where intraguild competition is frequent. Therefore, assessing the role of interspecific interactions along with the relative importance of landscape characteristics is necessary to understand how these species co-occur in space. Here, we selected three morphologically similar and closely related species of small Neotropical cats to evaluate the roles of interspecific interactions, geomorphometry, environmental, and anthropogenic landscape characteristics on their habitat use. We collected data with camera trapping and scat sampling in a large protected Atlantic forest remnant (35,000 ha). Throughout occupancy modeling we investigated whether these species occur together more or less frequently than would be expected by chance, while dealing with imperfect detection and incorporating possible habitat preferences into the models. We used occupancy as a measure of their habitat use. Although intraguild competition can be an important determinant of carnivore assemblages, in our system, we did not find evidence that one species affects the habitat use of the other. Evidence suggested that proximity to the nature reserve (a more protected area) was a more important driver of Neotropical spotted cats’ occurrence than interspecific interactions or geomorphometry and environmental landscape characteristics—even though our entire study area is under some type of protection. This suggests that small felids can be sensitive to the area protection status, emphasizing the importance of maintaining and creating reserves and other areas with elevated protection for the proper management and conservation of the group.},

	abstract = {From 1996 to 2001, we conducted a study of two adjacent rodent communities in the Mapimi Basin of the Chihuahuan desert in Mexico. The objective was to test the resource level hypothesis in explaining differences in two contrasting but spatially close habitats: a tobosa grassland area (Hilaria mutica) and a mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa)–creosote (Larrea tridentata)–prickly pear (Opuntia rastrera) shrubland. Based on the inherent differences in the two habitats, we made the following predictions relative to the resource level hypothesis: (1) shrublands should have higher inherent density, diversity, and richness of small mammals than grasslands; (2) annual and seasonal changes in density, diversity, richness, and community composition should be more pronounced in grassland than in shrubland. Concerning the first set of predictions, rodent density was higher in the shrubland (17.7±1.1ind/ha) than the grassland (5.8±0.7ind/ha; F1,48=292.2, p⩽0.001). Overall species richness was equal in both habitats but the richness at any given time was significantly higher in shrubland (7.5±0.2 species vs. 5.6±0.3 species, F1,48=35.0, p⩽0.001). Species diversity, however, was equal in both habitats. Concerning the second set of predictions, rodent densities differed significantly in both areas annually (grassland: F5,24=10.9, p{\textless}0.001; shrubland F5,24=11.0, p{\textless}0.001) and seasonally (grassland: F1,24=27.2, p{\textless}0.001; shrubland: F1,24=15.3, p{\textless}0.001). However, the variability in the relative number of individuals captured per year was higher in the grassland compared to the shrubland. Also, rodent densities in grasslands responded directly to the amount of precipitation of the previous calendar year while those in shrubland did not respond until November. The composition of the rodent community, as expressed by the first principal component of a principal components analysis varied yearly and seasonally for both shrubland (annual: F5,24=14.6, p{\textless}0.001, seasonal: F1,34=12.1, p{\textgreater}0.001) and the grassland (annual: F5,24=3.01, p=0.03, seasonal: F1,24=13.5, p=0.001). However, we found changes in community structure in grasslands but not in shrubland were related to previous year precipitation levels. We suggest that differences between the two areas reflected the higher productivity and biomass stability in the shrubland compared to the grassland. Consequently, we concluded that the results in general supported the resource level hypothesis in explaining the structure and dynamics of rodent communities in the Chihuahuan desert.},

Predictions for the top-down hypothesis were, 1) a positive relationship between coyote (Canis latrans) and jackrabbit abundance (numerical response) and 2) a positive relationship between percent occurrence of jackrabbits in coyote scats and jackrabbit abundance (functional response). Predictions for the bottom-up hypothesis were, 1) plant productivity is directly related to precipitation, 2) jackrabbit abundance is positively related to precipitation and plant productivity, and 3) changes in abundance of jackrabbits over the reproductive season will be directly related to precipitation and plant productivity. We found a limited numerical response but no functional response of coyotes to jackrabbit abundance. Forb productivity was significantly related to annual precipitation levels (r2 = 0.69, p = 0.002). Grass productivity was related to annual precipitation (r2 = 0.34, p = 0.028). Jackrabbit abundance (r2 = 0.38, p = 0.002) and changes in abundance (r2 = 0.73, p {\textless} 0.001) were significantly related to precipitation and forb and grass productivity. We conclude that precipitation levels and plant productivity affect jackrabbit abundance more than predation levels.},

	abstract = {Tilman's model predicts an asymmetric relationship, with ascending, peak, and descending parts, between plant species diversity and a resource gradient. I evaluated the applicability of Tilman's model to mammals by regressing rodent and carnivore species diversity on estimates of net aboveground primary productivity. Rodent diversity was highest at low productivity levels and declined as productivity increased. Although my data did not confirm the upslope and peak phases of Tilman's model, this may be because I did not sample from areas of extremely low productivity. Published studies from very dry desert habitats indicate that rodent diversity increases rapidly across a narrow gradient of very low productivity and peaks at moderately low levels. This suggests that rodents, which are largely herbivorous, exhibit an asymmetric productivity-diversity curve similar to that predicted by Tilman for plants. The rodent data are also consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, which predicts diversity as a peaked function of a disturbance gradient. Rainfall predictability, which may function as a disturbance, is inversely related to my plant productivity gradient. The regression curve for carnivores helps to distinguish between these two hypotheses. At a given locality carnivores and rodents should be exposed to about the same disturbance levels and according to the intermediate disturbance model should peak at about the same place. Since carnivores as a whole are about one trophic level above rodents, if plant productivity controls diversity the peak for carnivores should occur at about an order of magnitude of productivity higher than the peak for rodents. My carnivore diversity data exhibit upslope, peak, and downslope phases and are shifted to higher levels of productivity by about one order of magnitude. This provides evidence against the intermediate disturbance hypotheses and corroborates predictions of Tilman's model as applied to mammals.},

We also calculated the spatial correlations in precipitation, plant cover, and rodent dynamics among six sites, five at Sevilleta and one at Portal. At Sevilleta, all three variables were temporally correlated, with plant cover responding to precipitation during the same growing season and rodent populations lagging at least one season behind. At Portal, plant stem count was also correlated with precipitation during the same growing season, but there was no significant correlation between rodents and either precipitation or plant growth. Spatial correlations in plant cover and rodent populations between sites reflected the localized nature of summer rainfall, so that sites with highly correlated summer precipitation exhibited higher correlations in plant cover and rodent populations. In general, our results indicate that limiting resources influence consumer dynamics, but these dynamics also depend crucially on the biotic interactions in the system.},

Spectral models and indices are being developed to improve vegetation sensitivity by accounting for atmosphere and soil effects. The soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was developed to minimize soil influences on canopy spectra by incorporating a soil adjustment factor L into the denominator of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) equation. For optimal adjustment of the soil effect, however, the L factor should vary inversely with the amount of vegetation present. A modified SAVI (MSAVI) that replaces the constant L in the SAVI equation with a variable L function is presented in this article. The L function may be derived by induction or by using the product of the NDVI and weighted difference vegetation index (WDVI). Results based on ground and aircraft-measured cotton canopies are presented. The MSAVI is shown to increase the dynamic range of the vegetation signal while further minimizing the soil background influences, resulting in greater vegetation sensitivity as defined by a “vegetation signal” to “soil noise” ratio.},

	abstract = {Competition theory and niche theory suggest that two morphologically similar species may coexist by reducing the overlap of at least one dimension of their ecological niche. The medium and small Neotropical felids are an interesting group of carnivore species for studying intraguild competition. Due to differences in size it is expected that the larger ocelot exert strong interference competition on the smaller felids (southern tiger cat, margay and jaguarundi); which, in turn, may exert exploitative competition among themselves. Moreover, landscape changes due to human activities may alter these interspecific interactions. We studied the habitat use and the spatial and temporal interspecific relations of the medium and small Atlantic Forest felids, in a landscape with different levels of anthropogenic impact. We estimated the detection probability, and occupancy probability of these cats and whether these parameters are affected by environmental and anthropogenic variables or by the estimated occupancy and detection probability of the ocelot. We estimated the overlap in daily activity patterns between pairs of the four species and changes in their activity in response to anthropogenic impact. We also studied the potential changes that may have occurred in the daily activity of the small felids in relation to ocelot's occupancy probability. The probability of habitat use of the small- and medium-size felids was negatively associated to the intensity of landscape use by humans. Co-occurrence models indicated that the probability of habitat use by southern tiger cats decreased with ocelot occupancy probability. This effect was higher as human disturbance increased. Moreover, the ocelot and the southern tiger cat became more nocturnal in sites with higher human access, suggesting that they may be temporally avoiding encounters with humans or dogs. Conservation of medium and small felids in the Atlantic Forest depends not only on the establishment and implementations of protected areas but also on the management of human's land uses.},

This results in increased interactions with native wildlife. In Madagascar, we know relatively little about the effects of domestic and/or feral dogs and cats on native carnivore populations. We investigated spatial interactions by combining photographic sampling across seven sites with two-species co-occurrence modeling to provide the first assessment of the spatial co-occurrence of native and exotic carnivores in Madagascar, including an examination of habitat characteristics that explain these relationships. Our surveys from 2008 to 2013 accumulated 2991 photo-captures of native and exotic carnivores in 8854 trap nights. We found that native and exotic carnivores in rainforest habitat occur together less often than expected and that exotic carnivores may be replacing native carnivores, particularly in forest areas nearest villages. Six of the native carnivores in this study had higher site use in the absence of exotic carnivores and their species interaction factors (SIF) revealed a lack of co-occurrence (e.g. SIF {\textless} 1.0). We found that nocturnal and/or crepuscular native carnivores were less likely to co-occur with exotic carnivores. We demonstrate the effectiveness of combining photographic sampling with co-occurrence modeling to investigate the effects of exotic carnivores on an entire community of native carnivores. Our study exposes the strong negative influence of exotic carnivores, ranging from exclusion to complete replacement of native carnivores, and we urgently recommend a combination of targeted educational programs and removal programs to combat the influx of exotic carnivores.},

	abstract = {The largest remaining black-tailed prairie dog Cynomys ludovicianus towns in North America are in Mexico, where they coexist with the kit fox Vulpes macrotis, providing a unique opportunity to study the relationship between these threatened species. We hypothesized that the presence of prairie dogs would positively affect the kit fox population in our study area in north-western Mexico, and that these influences would be manifest in home-range size, density and habitat selection. We estimated fox densities fluctuating from 0.32/km2 to 0.8/km2, and radio-telemetry revealed minimum convex polygon home ranges averaging 11 km2. These values are within the bounds of estimates from study sites elsewhere. Foxes used mesquite scrub less than expected, but grassland more than expected in relation to availability. Other habitats, including prairie dog towns, were used at random. Most (65.1\% of 43) fox dens were in grassland, and were enlarged kangaroo rat Dipodomys spp. (34.9\%) or prairie dog (34.9\%) burrows. That kit foxes seemed to select grasslands rather than prairie dog towns was unexpected, particularly as prairie dogs are known to be a major component of kit fox diet. Foxes may reduce the amount of time they spend in prairie dog towns to avoid coyotes, which can be responsible for significant swift fox mortality. In our study area, coyotes were more active in prairie dog towns than in the grassland, where they were regularly shot. However, grassland used by kit foxes is a short-lived product of prairie dog poisoning, which is quickly invaded by scrub, a habitat favoured by coyotes. We conclude that kit fox conservation initiatives in north-western Mexico should be closely linked to conservation of the prairie dog ecosystem.},

Traditional statistical inference can then be based on this selected best model. However, we now emphasize that information-theoretic approaches allow formal inference to be based on more than one model (m- timodel inference). Such procedures lead to more robust inferences in many cases, and we advocate these approaches throughout the book. The second edition was prepared with three goals in mind. First, we have tried to improve the presentation of the material. Boxes now highlight ess- tial expressions and points. Some reorganization has been done to improve the ?ow of concepts, and a new chapter has been added. Chapters 2 and 4 have been streamlined in view of the detailed theory provided in Chapter 7. S- ond, concepts related to making formal inferences from more than one model (multimodel inference) have been emphasized throughout the book, but p- ticularly in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Third, new technical material has been added to Chapters 5 and 6. Well over 100 new references to the technical literature are given.

To accurately evaluate such effect, landscape metrics need to be assessed at the correct scale, i.e. considering the spatial extent at which species–landscape relationship is strongest (scale of effect, SE). Although SE is highly variable, its drivers are poorly known, but of key relevance to understand the way species use the landscape. In this study, we evaluate whether and how species traits, biological responses, landscape variables and the regional context of the study drive SE in Mexican primates. We estimated the relative abundance and immature-to-female ratio (a proxy of reproductive success) of howler monkeys Alouatta palliata and A. pigra and spider monkeys Ateles geoffroyi in 48 forest patches from four rainforest regions (12 patches per region) with different land-use intensity. We then assessed the composition (forest cover, matrix functionality) and configuration (forest patch density, connectors’ density, forest edge density) of local landscapes considering 13 scales (100 to 1300-m radius) to identify the spatial extent at which each landscape variable best predict each response variable in each species and region. We found that SE did not differ significantly among the drivers evaluated. However, it tended to be lower for connectors’ density than for forest patch density and forest edge density, probably because connectors’ density is associated with local-scale processes such as supplementary dynamics. Surprisingly, SE also tended to be higher in the more disturbed region than in the rest of the regions, probably because primates in the more disturbed region used larger areas of the landscape. Our findings therefore suggest that SE depends more strongly on landscape variables and regional context than on species traits and biological responses, and hence, especial caution should be taken when attempting to generalize SE to different explanatory variables and regions.},

	abstract = {Although the Andes have long been occupied by people, habitat loss, fragmentation through deforestation, and other human activities such as introduction of invasive species have increased drastically during the past century. The Ecuadorian Andes are considered a biodiversity hotspot. However, the fauna and threats to the region are poorly studied, and understanding of factors that shape the distribution of species in habitats disturbed by human activities is needed to identify and mitigate region-wide threats to wildlife. We evaluated factors associated with patterns of occurrence of Andean carnivores in landscapes of the northern Ecuadorian Andes, particularly habitat loss, fragmentation, and occupancy of domestic dogs, and determined whether thresholds occurred for these factors beyond which carnivore occurrence declined markedly. Five study areas (each 20 x 20 km) were surveyed with a total effort of 2,800 camera trap nights. Occupancies of four of the eight carnivores known from the region were best predicted by occupancy of domestic dogs rather than measures of habitat loss and fragmentation [Andean fox (Pseudalopex culpaeus), puma (Puma concolor), striped hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus semistriatus), and Andean bear (Tremarctos ornatus)]. The two largest carnivores, puma and Andean bear, demonstrated significant threshold responses to the presence of domestic dogs at two sites. Four smaller carnivores were recorded too infrequently to model occupancy, and at least two of these species appear to be in decline. The magnitude of domestic dog impacts on native species in tropical areas like the Ecuadorian Andes currently are not recognized. Results of our study indicate that small and large carnivores are in urgent need of conservation and clearly point to dogs as a significant threat to a broad range of native species.},

	abstract = {Estimating density of elusive carnivores with capture–recapture analyses is increasingly common. However, providing unbiased and precise estimates is still a challenge due to uncertainties arising from the use of (1) bait or lure to attract animals to the detection device and (2) ad hoc boundary-strip methods to compensate for edge effects in area estimation. We used photographic-sampling data of the Malagasy civet Fossa fossana collected with and without lure to assess the effects of lure and to compare the use of four density estimators which varied in methods of area estimation. The use of lure did not affect permanent immigration or emigration, abundance and density estimation, maximum movement distances, or temporal activity patterns of Malagasy civets, but did provide more precise population estimates by increasing the number of recaptures. The spatially-explicit capture–recapture (SECR) model density estimates ±SE were the least precise as they incorporate spatial variation, but consistent with each other (Maximum likelihood-SECR = 1.38 ± 0.18, Bayesian-SECR = 1.24 ± 0.17 civets/km2), whereas estimates relying on boundary-strip methods to estimate effective trapping area did not incorporate spatial variation, varied greatly and were generally larger than SECR model estimates. Estimating carnivore density with ad hoc boundary-strip methods can lead to overestimation and/or increased uncertainty as they do not incorporate spatial variation. This may lead to inaction or poor management decisions which may jeopardize at-risk populations. In contrast, SECR models free researchers from making subjective decisions associated with boundary-strip methods and they estimate density directly, providing more comparable and valuable population estimates.},

	abstract = {The geographic distribution of coyotes (Canis latrans) has dramatically expanded since 1900, spreading across much of North America in a period when most other mammal species have been declining. Although this considerable expansion has been well documented at the state/provincial scale, continent-wide descriptions of coyote spread have portrayed conflicting distributions for coyotes prior to the 1900s, with popularly referenced anecdotal accounts showing them restricted to the great plains, and more obscure, but data-rich accounts suggesting they ranged across the arid west. To provide a scientifically credible map of the coyote’s historical range (10,000–300 BP) and describe their range expansion from 1900 to 2016, we synthesized archaeological and fossil records, museum specimens, peer-reviewed reports, and records from wildlife management agencies. Museum specimens confirm that coyotes have been present in the arid west and California throughout the Holocene, well before European colonization. Their range in the late 1800s was undistinguishable from earlier periods, and matched the distribution of non-forest habitat in the region. Coyote expansion began around 1900 as they moved north into taiga forests, east into deciduous forests, west into costal temperate rain forests, and south into tropical rainforests. Forest fragmentation and the extirpation of larger predators probably enabled these expansions. In addition, hybridization with wolves (C. lupus, C. lycaon, and/or C. rufus) and/or domestic dogs has been documented in the east, and suspected in the south. Our detailed account of the original range of coyotes and their subsequent expansion provides the core description of a large scale ecological experiment that can help us better understand the predator-prey interactions, as well as evolution through hybridization.},

Mammalian carnivores are particularly vulnerable to local extinction in fragmented landscapes. However, our understanding of how shrub encroachment affects mammalian carnivores is poor. Here we investigated the relative sensitivities of ten native carnivores to different levels of shrub cover ranging from low ({\textless}5\%) to high shrub cover ({\textgreater}25\%) in 20 southern Kalahari rangeland sites. Relative abundance of carnivores was monitored along 40 sand transects (5m×250m) for each site. Our results show that increasing shrub cover affects carnivore species differently. African wild cats, striped polecats, cape foxes and suricates were negatively affected, whereas we found hump-shaped responses for yellow mongooses, bat-eared foxes and small-spotted genets with maximum abundance at shrub covers between 10 and 18\%. In contrast, black-backed jackals, slender mongooses and small spotted cats were not significantly affected by increasing shrub cover. However, a negative impact of high shrub cover above 18\% was congruent for all species. We conclude that intermediate shrub cover (10–18\%) in savanna landscapes sustain viable populations of small carnivores.},

	abstract = {One of the most important conservation issues in ecology is the imperiled state of grassland ecosystems worldwide due to land conversion, desertification, and the loss of native populations and species. The Janos region of northwestern Mexico maintains one of the largest remaining black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colony complexes in North America and supports a high diversity of threatened and endangered species. Yet, cattle grazing, agriculture, and drought have greatly impacted the region. We evaluated the impact of human activities on the Janos grasslands, comparing changes in the vertebrate community over the last two decades. Our results reveal profound, rapid changes in the Janos grassland community, demonstrating large declines in vertebrate abundance across all taxonomic groups. We also found that the 55,000 ha prairie dog colony complex has declined by 73\% since 1988. The prairie dog complex has become increasingly fragmented, and their densities have shown a precipitous decline over the years, from an average density of 25 per ha in 1988 to 2 per ha in 2004. We demonstrated that prairie dogs strongly suppressed woody plant encroachment as well as created open grassland habitat by clearing woody vegetation, and found rapid invasion of shrubland once the prairie dogs disappeared from the grasslands. Comparison of grasslands and shrublands showed markedly different species compositions, with species richness being greatest when both habitats were considered together. Our data demonstrate the rapid decline of a grassland ecosystem, and documents the dramatic loss in biodiversity over a very short time period concomitant with anthropogenic grassland degradation and the decline of a keystone species.},

	abstract = {Theoretical work on intraguild predation suggests that if a top predator and an intermediate predator share prey, the system will be stable only if the intermediate predator is better at exploiting the prey, and the top predator gains signiﬁcantly from consuming the intermediate predator. In mammalian carnivore systems, however, there are examples of top predator species that attack intermediate predator species, but rarely or never consume the intermediate predator. We suggest that top predators attacking intermediate predators without consuming them may not only reduce competition with the intermediate predators, but may also increase the vigilance of the intermediate predators or alter the vigilance of their shared prey, and that this behavioral response may help to maintain the stability of the system. We examine two models of intraguild predation, one that incorporates prey vigilance, and a second that incorporates intermediate predator vigilance. We ﬁnd that stable coexistence can occur when the top predator has a very low consumption rate on the intermediate predator, as long as the attack rate on the intermediate predator is relatively large. However, the system is stable when the top predator never consumes the intermediate predator only if the two predators share more than one prey species. If the predators do share two prey species, and those prey are vigilant, increasing top predator attack rates on the intermediate predator reduces competition with the intermediate predator and reduces vigilance by the prey, thereby leading to higher top predator densities. These results suggest that predator and prey behavior may play an important dynamical role in systems with intraguild predation.},

	abstract = {We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1 km2). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15\% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

	abstract = {Development and evaluation of noninvasive methods for monitoring species distribution and abundance is a growing area of ecological research. While noninvasive methods have the advantage of reduced risk of negative factors associated with capture, comparisons to methods using more traditional invasive sampling is lacking. Historically kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis) occupied the desert and semi-arid regions of southwestern North America. Once the most abundant carnivore in the Great Basin Desert of Utah, the species is now considered rare. In recent decades, attempts have been made to model the environmental variables influencing kit fox distribution. Using noninvasive scat deposition surveys for determination of kit fox presence, we modeled resource selection functions to predict kit fox distribution using three popular techniques (Maxent, fixed-effects, and mixed-effects generalized linear models) and compared these with similar models developed from invasive sampling (telemetry locations from radio-collared foxes). Resource selection functions were developed using a combination of landscape variables including elevation, slope, aspect, vegetation height, and soil type. All models were tested against subsequent scat collections as a method of model validation. We demonstrate the importance of comparing multiple model types for development of resource selection functions used to predict a species distribution, and evaluating the importance of environmental variables on species distribution. All models we examined showed a large effect of elevation on kit fox presence, followed by slope and vegetation height. However, the invasive sampling method (i.e., radio-telemetry) appeared to be better at determining resource selection, and therefore may be more robust in predicting kit fox distribution. In contrast, the distribution maps created from the noninvasive sampling (i.e., scat transects) were significantly different than the invasive method, thus scat transects may be appropriate when used in an occupancy framework to predict species distribution. We concluded that while scat deposition transects may be useful for monitoring kit fox abundance and possibly occupancy, they do not appear to be appropriate for determining resource selection. On our study area, scat transects were biased to roadways, while data collected using radio-telemetry was dictated by movements of the kit foxes themselves. We recommend that future studies applying noninvasive scat sampling should consider a more robust random sampling design across the landscape (e.g., random transects or more complete road coverage) that would then provide a more accurate and unbiased depiction of resource selection useful to predict kit fox distribution.},

Recently a model has been developed that enables estimation of the proportion of area occupied, when the target species is not detected with certainty. Here we apply this modeling approach to data collected on terrestrial salamanders in the Plethodon glutinosus complex in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA, and wish to address the question “how accurately does the fitted model represent the data?” The goodness-of-fit of the model needs to be assessed in order to make accurate inferences. This article presents a method where a simple Pearson chi-square statistic is calculated and a parametric bootstrap procedure is used to determine whether the observed statistic is unusually large. We found evidence that the most global model considered provides a poor fit to the data, hence estimated an overdispersion factor to adjust model selection procedures and inflate standard errors. Two hypothetical datasets with known assumption violations are also analyzed, illustrating that the method may be used to guide researchers to making appropriate inferences. The results of a simulation study are presented to provide a broader view of the methods properties.},

	abstract = {The abstract concept of "information" can be quantified and this has led to many important advances in the analysis of data in the empirical sciences. This text focuses on a science philosophy based on "multiple working hypotheses" and statistical models to represent them. The fundamental science question relates to the empirical evidence for hypotheses in this set—a formal strength of evidence. Kullback-Leibler information is the information lost when a model is used to approximate full reality. Hirotugu Akaike found a link between K-L information (a cornerstone of information theory) and the maximized log-likelihood (a cornerstone of mathematical statistics). This combination has become the basis for a new paradigm in model based inference. The text advocates formal inference from all the hypotheses/models in the a priori set—multimodel inference. This compelling approach allows a simple ranking of the science hypothesis and their models. Simple methods are introduced for computing the likelihood of model i, given the data; the probability of model i, given the data; and evidence ratios. These quantities represent a formal strength of evidence and are easy to compute and understand, given the estimated model parameters and associated quantities (e.g., residual sum of squares, maximized log-likelihood, and covariance matrices). Additional forms of multimodel inference include model averaging, unconditional variances, and ways to rank the relative importance of predictor variables. This textbook is written for people new to the information-theoretic approaches to statistical inference, whether graduate students, post-docs, or professionals in various universities, agencies or institutes. Readers are expected to have a background in general statistical principles, regression analysis, and some exposure to likelihood methods.

Tapir, white-lipped peccary (WLP), collared peccary, two species of brocket deer and white-tailed deer were the focal species. Relative abundance of ungulates was obtained by counting tracks along transects in three hunted sites and in the southern core area of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, a enforced part of the protected area of 350,000 ha where no hunting has been-permitted since 1989. A total of 1708 ungulates tracks were obtained along 206.1 km (n = 90 transects) divided among the four sites. Relative abundance of the species was estimated from the track encounter rate (TER) calculated as the number of tracks per species encountered per km of transect. No significant differences in brocket deer and collared peccary TER was found among hunted and non-hunted areas. TER for WLP was significant higher in the non-hunted area, while TER for white-tailed deer and tapir was significant higher in hunted sites. Hunting activity affected the ungulate species in Calakmul differently. Brocket deer, white-tailed deer and collared peccary are more resistant species toward the hunting pressure than the WLP, who needs an immediate protection plan throughout Calakmul. Hunting areas are important habitat refuges for tapir populations and they should be protected in these areas.},

	abstract = {This study tests hypotheses on the biochemical functions of geophagy in parrots: mechanical enhancement of digestion, acid buffering capacity, mineral supplementation, adsorption of dietary toxins, and gastrointestinal cytoprotection. Parrots showed clear preferences for specific soil horizons. Comparisons of preferred and nonpreferred soils from several sites suggest that soils have little ability to enhance grinding and no measurable ability to buffer gastric pH. Soils offered insignificant mineral supplementation since most minerals occurred at similar levels in samples regardless of preference, and the minerals were generally more plentiful in the birds' diets. Sodium was available in moderate levels at some sites ({\textgreater}1000 ppm), but was well below sodium detection thresholds of parrots. X-ray diffraction, cation exchange capacity, and in vitro adsorptive trials showed that the preferred soils are capable of exchanging substantial quantities of cations and are capable of adsorbing low-molecular-weight secondary compounds. In captive Amazona parrots, orally administered clay reduced the bioavailability of the alkaloid quinidine by roughly 60\%, demonstrating that in vivo adsorption of potentially toxic compounds may be a biologically important function of geophagy. Labeled clay remained in the lower gastrointestinal tract of captive parrots for {\textgreater}12 hr, which along with high adsorptive capacities, further suggests a potential role in protecting the gastrointestinal lining from various biological and chemical insults. Detoxification and cytoprotection are the most likely functions of geophagy for parrots and herbivores with similar ecologies. Given the variety of chemically defended seeds consumed by these herbivores, geophagy likely protects consumers from dietary toxins, allowing increased diet breadth and/or enhancing digestibility.},

Some environmental conditions and resources are characterized by large-scale patterns of variation within the landscape. Clumped local discontinuities or discrete elements also increase spatial heterogeneity, promoting local ‘biodiversity hot spots’ by modifying habitat characteristics and promoting plant–animal interactions. Clay licks are faunal attractors owing to their role in the nutritional ecology of the user species; nevertheless, the effect of their presence on the surrounding vegetation has been poorly quantified. Here, we use data from 100 × 10 m transects and evaluate the effects of the presence of clay licks on forest diversity and structure at local and landscape scales. In clay lick areas, there was a higher abundance of certain species, which helps to homogenize species composition between localities counteracting the natural distance-decay of compositional similarity between transects without clay lick influence (controls). Compared to control sites, clay lick′s forests had higher palm densities, shorter but more variable individuals in the canopy and understory, a thinner canopy layer, and denser herbaceous and ground level covers. These differences were found along the whole length of transects in both sampled areas types. These results reveal that the presence of discrete elements (i.e., clay licks) may help to explain the compositional and structural heterogeneity of Amazonian forests influencing ecological processes such as seed dispersal and trampling. These considerations may be relevant for other biomes where clay licks are present and give weight to their inclusion in conservation initiatives in tropical forests.},

The diversity of species that visit such sites makes them important for conservation, particularly given that hunters often target animals at licks. Use of mineral licks varies among species, with frugivores among the most common visitors but there is considerable temporal and spatial variation in lick use both within and among species. Camera traps triggered by heat and motion were used to document use of mineral licks by birds and non-volant mammals over a four-year period at a lowland forest site in eastern Ecuador. We obtained 7,889 photographs representing 23 mammal species and 888 photographs representing 15 bird species. Activity (photographs/100 trap-days) at the four licks varied from 89 to 292 for mammals and from six to 43 for birds. Tapirs (Tapirus terrestris), peccaries (Pecari tajacu, Tayassu pecari), deer (Mazama americana), and pacas (Cuniculus paca) were the most frequent mammal visitors; guans (Pipile pipile) and pigeons (Columba plumbea) were the most common birds. Use of licks varied diurnally and seasonally but patterns of use varied among species and sites. Mineral licks provide an important resource for many species but further studies are needed to determine the precise benefit(s) obtained and how benefits may vary with diet and other factors, such as rainfall.},

The function of geophagy is not fully understood and likely varies over space and time, perhaps in connection with changes in diet. Central to a better understanding of geophagy in primate ecology is knowledge of the occurrence of such behavior among different species and seasons. We used camera traps triggered by heat and motion to document the use of mineral licks by primates over a 3-yr period at a lowland forest site in eastern Ecuador (Tiputini Biodiversity Station). Such mineral licks can be important sources of minerals, nutrients, and other compounds for a wide range of species in Amazonian forests. Although 10 species of primates are known from the study site, we obtained photographs of only 2 species, Ateles belzebuth (white-bellied spider monkey) and Alouatta seniculus (red howler) at 2 of 4 saladeros surveyed. From late December 2004 through early January 2008, we recorded 192 photographs with a total of 318 Ateles belzebuth representing ≥66 separate visits. Comparable numbers for Alouatta seniculus were 80, 121, and 37. We recorded both species visiting a mineral lick at the same time on ≥7 occasions. Use of mineral licks varied across months; we recorded more visits from November through February, the drier period at Tiputini. Visits also varied by hour, with no visits before 0830 or after 1630; Ateles belzebuth showed a stronger mid-day peak in visits. Average visit length (calculated as the time between the first and last photographs of a given visit) was similar between the 2 species but median visit length was more than twice as long for Ateles belzebuth (15 min) as for Alouatta seniculus (6 min). Results indicate that mineral licks are important in the ecology of these species, but further studies are needed to determine the precise benefit(s) obtained and how benefits may vary with diet and other factors.},

Se caracterizaron y monitorearon por fototrampeo 57 sitios de alimentación (“comederos”), en 31 de los cuales se confirmó el consumo de frutos. Comparando los sitios se encontraron diferencias significativas en el estado y cantidad de frutos y la cobertura del dosel. La dieta del tepezcuintle incluyó frutos de 20 especies de árboles, donde Ceiba pentandra y Castilla elastica fueron nuevos registros para la especie. Se encontró una semejanza del 40\% en la composición de especies arbóreas consumidas entre sitios, por lo que el tepezcuintle diversifica su dieta aprovechando frutos de especies cultivadas.Palabras clave: Dieta; Frugívoro; Fragmentación; Tepezcuintle},

They differed from each other in the proportions of pulp and secondary foods (leaves, fibre, insects) consumed annually as well as seasonally. Dietary diversity in the acouchy was half that of the two other species. The seasonal variation in consumption of different fruit parts and of secondary foods by these species corresponded well with the fruit production in the forest, and was linked to their reproductive events. Overall, the diets of these three large rodents appeared intermediate between the small rodent species and the artiodactyls (peccaries and brocket deer) inhabiting the same areas, which also concords with their body mass and their place within the guild of terrestrial mammals.},

Analyses of 22 stomach contents of P. tajacu revealed that this species consume more fruits (57.9 \%) than leaves (30.1). From 37 plant species found to be consumed by P. tajacu, the dominant species were: Brosimum alicastrum, Manilkara zapota, Pipper amalago, Zea maiz and an unidentified species. We analyzed nine stomach contents and 16 feces of T. pecari and found that he feeds on 41 species of plants where the main components were fruits too (81.2 \% on stomach and 66.8 \% on feces). The main species consumed by T. pecari were B. alicastrum, Chamaedorea sp, M. zapota, Mimosa sp, P. amalago and one unidentified species. Despite both peccary species shared 32 species on their diet, their feeding niche was not significant overlapped. Collared peccary and white-lipped peccary are playing a seed predator role for several of the species on which they feed upon. KEY WORDS: Calakmul, diet, coexistence, Tayassuidae, Tayassu pecari and Pecari tajacu},

Camera traps triggered by heat and motion were used to document use of mineral licks by birds and mammals over approximately 2 months at two lowland forest sites in eastern Ecuador, one that has experienced considerable hunting by indigenous Waorani (four mineral licks) and one that is largely unaffected by hunting (ﬁve licks). We obtained 264 photographs representing nine mammal species and one photograph of a bird at the hunted site; 1123 photographs of 12 mammal species and 73 of three bird species were obtained at the site without hunting. Photographs were counted if at least 30 min elapsed between photographs of the same species at the same camera location. Activity (photographs/100 trap-days) was higher at all licks at the site without hunting (mean = 436; range 276–665/100 trap-days) than at the hunted site (mean = 123; range 89–151/100 trap-days). Diurnal activity was, overall, lower at the hunted site, particularly during the middle of the day. Species not recorded at the hunted site included two primates (white-bellied spider monkey Ateles belzebuth; Venezuelan red howler monkey Alouatta seniculus), white-lipped peccary, Tayassu pecari and two large-bodied birds (common piping-guan, Pipile pipile; Salvin’s curassow, Mitu salvini); all are common prey of local hunters. Red brocket deer, Mazama americana was the most frequently photographed species at both sites, but was less active during the day at the hunted site.},

	abstract = {Animal movement characteristics are not species-specific traits, but rather individual features that respond to various selective pressures. To understand patterns of animal movements, it is especially important to explore how they are affected by differences in landscape and habitat configuration. This paper presents an analysis of the movement patterns of a species of conservation concern in Northwest Amazon, the lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), in relation to landscape elements identified as resource concentration areas (palm stands and natural salt licks). We identify the structure of the movement behavior of a sub-adult male lowland tapir using Behavioral Change Point Analysis (BCPA) and a set of metrics capturing velocity and variance. We also estimate this tapir’s Utilization Distribution (UD) using the dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Model (dBBMM) in order to better understand its trajectories and space-use patterns. Our results provide insights about this animal’s movement, making it possible to differentiate between foraging behaviors, characterized by long trips and selective resource use, and explorative behaviors, characterized by short displacements and a notable decrease in the usage of resource areas and its trajectories. The high influence of landscape elements on movement characteristics suggest that tapirs may perceive the Amazonian forest as heterogeneous rather than homogeneous mosaics. Therefore, the study of movement characteristics proves to be useful for the development of future studies and conservation plans.},

Using contemporary coexistence theory that emphasizes stabilizing niche differences and relative fitness differences, we evaluate three empirical approaches for studying community assembly. We show that experimental manipulations of the abiotic or biotic environment, assessments of trait-phylogeny-environment relationships, and investigations of frequency-dependent population growth all suggest strong influences of stabilizing niche differences and fitness differences on the outcome of plant community assembly. Nonetheless, due to the limitations of these approaches applied in isolation, we still have a poor understanding of which niche axes and which traits determine the outcome of competition and community structure. Combining current approaches represents our best chance of achieving this goal, which is fundamental to conceptual ecology and to the management of plant communities under global change.},

The aim is to determine temporal trends, scientific journals, species, research groups, regions, and key topics investigated using this technology. A secondary objective of this paper was to illustrate the usefulness of text mining tools to analyze and summarize relatively large amounts of information. Papers about photo-trapping in Mexico published in specialized journals and books from 1998 to 2017 were compiled from Google Scholar and processed with various packages in R. A total of 188 papers about photo-trapping in Mexico were compiled, with 88.2 \% published in 50 journals over the past seven years. The main journals were Therya, Revista Mexicana de Biodiversidad, Acta Zoologica Mexicana (New Series) and Revista de Biología Tropical. The articles identified were written by 406 co-authors, 28 of whom contributed with 32.4 \% of the papers published. A total of 40 species were reported in the title and abstract of these papers; the most frequent species were Panthera onca, Leopardus pardalis, Puma concolor, Tapirus bairdii, Tayassu pecari, Odocoileus virginianus, and Cuniculus paca. Oaxaca, Campeche, Sonora, Chiapas, Guanajuato, and Puebla were the main states where studies were conducted; in particular, most of them were carried out within Biosphere Reserves. Major research topics comprised records that broaden the distribution range, estimates of relative abundance and density, analysis of activity patterns, ecological interactions between species, and use of photo-trapping data as supplementary information to elaborate inventories of species. The analysis of text mining clearly indicates a trend towards an increasing use of photo-trapping in Mexico. Felines, ungulates and various species of the order Carnivora are main subjects of study. Photo-trapping has been used to explore a number of aspects of the biology of animal species. A large number of studies have been carried out in southeastern Mexico. The use of text mining techniques is a practical approach to analyze large volumes of data.},

Habitat associations for individual species are well-established, and interactions between particular pairs of species have been highlighted in many focal studies. However, community-wide assessments of the relative strengths of these two factors have not been conducted. We built multi-scale habitat occupancy models for five carnivore taxa of New York’s Adirondack landscape and assessed the relative performance of these models against ones in which co-occurrences of potentially competing carnivore species were also incorporated. Distribution models based on habitat performed well for all species. Black bear (Ursus americanus) and fisher (Martes pennanti) distribution was similar in that occupancy of both species was negatively associated with paved roads. However, black bears were also associated with larger forest fragments and fishers with smaller forest fragments. No models with habitat features were more supported than the null habitat model for raccoons (Procyon lotor). Martens (Martes americana) were most associated with increased terrain ruggedness and elevation. Weasel (Mustela spp.) occupancy increased with the cover of deciduous forest. For most species dyads habitat-only models were more supported than those models with potential competitors incorporated. The exception to this finding was for the smallest carnivore taxa (marten and weasel) where habitat plus coyote abundance models typically performed better than habitat-only models. Assessing this carnivore community as whole, we conclude that differential habitat use is more important than species interactions in maintaining the distribution and structure of this carnivore guild.},

	abstract = {The mesopredator release hypothesis (MRH) has been suggested as a reason why many mammalian generalist mesopredators flourish and become abundant. However, the MRH has only been examined in a limited number of field studies. Some studies have argued that coyotes (Canis latrans) act as top predators in fragmented forest systems and coyote presence has a positive effect on song bird diversity and abundance by controlling mesopredator abundance. We integrated camera trap data and occupancy modeling to determine the factors that affect coyote detection probability and habitat use in a fragmented suburban landscape in central Missouri. We then examined the influence of coyote presence and other habitat variables on mesopredator detection probability and habitat use in the same system. Coyote detection was negatively related to increasing forest cover, whereas red fox (Vulpes vulpes) detection was positively related to increasing urbanization. Coyote occurrence models suggested little habitat selection, while the mesopredator occurrence models suggested an affinity for urbanization. Although there was a slight negative effect of coyote presence on site use by other mesopredators, we suggest that the smaller species are better adapted to coexisting with humans and thus have increased in abundance.},

	abstract = {[Most ecosystems have multiple predator species that not only compete for shared prey, but also pose direct threats to each other. These intraguild interactions are key drivers of carnivore community structure, with ecosystem-wide cascading effects. Yet, behavioral mechanisms for coexistence of multiple carnivore species remain poorly understood. The challenges of studying large, free-ranging carnivores have resulted in mainly coarse-scale examination of behavioral strategies without information about all interacting competitors. We overcame some of these challenges by examining the concurrent fine-scale movement decisions of almost all individuals of four large mammalian carnivore species in a closed terrestrial system. We found that the intensity of intraguild interactions did not follow a simple hierarchical allometric pattern, because spatial and behavioral tactics of subordinate species changed with threat and resource levels across seasons. Lions (Panthera leo) were generally unrestricted and anchored themselves in areas rich in not only their principal prey, but also, during periods of resource limitation (dry season), rich in the main prey for other carnivores. Because of this, the greatest cost (potential intraguild predation) for subordinate carnivores was spatially coupled with the highest potential benefit of resource acquisition (prey-rich areas), especially in the dry season. Leopard (P. pardus) and cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) overlapped with the home range of lions but minimized their risk using fine-scaled avoidance behaviors and restricted resource acquisition tactics. The cost of intraguild competition was most apparent for cheetahs, especially during the wet season, as areas with energetically rewarding large prey (wildebeest) were avoided when they overlapped highly with the activity areas of lions. Contrary to expectation, the smallest species (African wild dog, Lycaon pictus) did not avoid only lions, but also used multiple tactics to minimize encountering all other competitors. Intraguild competition thus forced wild dogs into areas with the lowest resource availability year round. Coexistence of multiple carnivore species has typically been explained by dietary niche separation, but our multi-scaled movement results suggest that differences in resource acquisition may instead be a consequence of avoiding intraguild competition. We generate a more realistic representation of hierarchical behavioral interactions that may ultimately drive spatially explicit trophic structures of multi-predator communities.]},

	abstract = {Top predators can dramatically suppress populations of smaller predators, with cascading effects throughout communities, and this pressure is often unquestioningly accepted as a constraint on mesopredator populations. In this study, we reassess whether African lions suppress populations of cheetahs and African wild dogs and examine possible mechanisms for coexistence between these species. Using long-term records from Serengeti National Park, we tested 30 years of population data for evidence of mesopredator suppression, and we examined six years of concurrent radio-telemetry data for evidence of large-scale spatial displacement. The Serengeti lion population nearly tripled between 1966 and 1998; during this time, wild dogs declined but cheetah numbers remained largely unchanged. Prior to their local extinction, wild dogs primarily occupied low lion density areas and apparently abandoned the long-term study area as the lion population 'saturated' the region. In contrast, cheetahs mostly utilized areas of high lion density, and the stability of the cheetah population indicates that neither high levels of lion-inflicted mortality nor behavioural avoidance inflict sufficient demographic consequences to translate into population-level effects. Population data from fenced reserves in southern Africa revealed a similar contrast between wild dogs and cheetahs in their ability to coexist with lions. These findings demonstrate differential responses of subordinate species within the same guild and challenge a widespread perception that lions undermine cheetah conservation efforts. Paired with several recent studies that document fine-scale lion-avoidance by cheetahs, this study further highlights fine-scale spatial avoidance as a possible mechanism for mitigating mesopredator suppression.},

	abstract = {Carnivores act as top-down regulators in terrestrial ecosystems, and their occurrence and relative abundance is a result of complex interactions between food and habitat availability, human pressure (e.g., trapping, hunting, roadkill) and intraguild interactions (competition, predation). Eastern United States has a long history of human impact, which resulted in an altered carnivore community. Specifically, Ohio presents an interesting case for evaluating the relative roles of interspecific relations and habitat characteristics for shaping the carnivore community, as its carnivore community has a unique dynamics and composition: invasive coyote and red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and native bobcat (Lynx rufus), currently recovering and expanding its range, gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) declining at a fast pace, and the generalist raccoon (Procyon lotor) and Virginian opossum (Didelphis virginiana). We used 50 camera traps to collect presence/absence data in southeastern Ohio, USA. We hypothesized potential interactions between the six carnivores, and used land cover variables, as well as occupancy probabilities of interacting species, to parameterize to single-species occupancy models. We found that landscape composition at three different scales (500m and 1000 m buffer around camera locations, and 3x3 km grid cell) had little effect on species occurrence. We identified strong negative interspecific relations between carnivores, with bobcat occurrence being influenced by presence of coyotes, red fox occurrence by gray foxes, and raccoon occurrence by Virginia possums. While these findings cannot discriminate between habitat partitioning (spatial or temporal) and competition (direct or interference), they lend support to complex dynamics between invasive coyotes and red foxes and recovering (bobcat) and declining (gray fox) native carnivore species. In particular, the negative relation between the apex predator in our system, C. latrans, and L. rufus, raise further questions on whether direct competition from coyotes has the potential to slow bobcat population recovery. In the context of regulated trapping (ongoing for gray fox and proposed season for bobcat), a better understanding of the carnivore intraguild relations can inform management and conservation actions targeted at minimizing the impact of competition on at-risk native species from non-native species.},

	abstract = {Background: We evaluated the strategies of resources partitioning among species, dietary overlap and niche breadth in an assemblage of carnivores integrated by top predators (Puma concolor and Panthera onca) and mesopredators (Leopardus pardalis, Leopardus wiedii, Puma yagouaroundi, Nasua narica and Urocyon cinereoargenteus). The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms explaining the coexistence among species at a temperate zone in central Mexico.
Results: We collected 259 scats of carnivores and identified 45 food items. The analysis showed the common consumption of mammals in the assemblage, and the correspondence analysis showed three guilds: 1) top predators associated with the use of medium-sized mammals and the exclusive consumption of large mammals, 2) carnivore mesopredators associated with the consumption of small mammals and birds and 3) omnivore mesopredators associated with the consumption of arthropods and plants. The dietary overlap analysis indicated a low overlap between guilds and a high overlap within them. Top predators were specialist foragers, whilst the carnivore mesopredators showed generalist consumption.
Conclusions: The coexistence in this carnivore assemblage seems to be related to body size, morphology and prey segregation because such characteristics suggest the presence of three guilds. We observed high dietary overlap within guilds and resource partitioning between guilds.},

Searches of transects for feces, tracks, and other evidence yielded the greatest number of detections; remotely triggered cameras and track plates had the greatest probabilities of detecting common species and also produced detections of smaller and rarer carnivores; and hair traps generally were ineffective. Even after accounting for variation in probabilities of use of habitats by species due to characteristics of sites, two pairs of carnivores had limited co-occurrence. Coyotes (Canis latrans) and bobcats (Lynx rufus) did not co-occur at sites on the North Rim, and coyotes and gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) co-occurred less than one-half as frequently as expected in the South Rim.},

In this chapter, we discuss the importance of defining key occupancy components (e.g., unit, season, survey, etc.). We describe optimal designs that provide the most precise estimates of occupancy for a given set of resource constraints, and provide some general recommendations. The ideas in this chapter should not be regarded as an instruction book for how to design your study, but a play book of options that may be appropriate in some situations, but not in others. Studies should be designed on a case-by-case basis, as the details of each design (goals, species, environment, etc.) will often be different. Once a satisfactory design has been developed, we recommend that simulation and pilot studies are invaluable tools for assessing whether the design will provide the type and quality of information required to meet the studies' objectives.

However, a key issue is that a species may be declared “absent” from a landscape unit simply as a result of not detecting the species using the prescribed sampling methods. The effect of this imperfect detection is that parameter estimates will be biased, and any modeling of the data provides a description of the surveyors' ability to find the species on the landscape, not where the species is on the landscape. The reliability of so-called “Presence-Absence” data for making sound management decisions and valid scientific conclusions could therefore be questioned. However, after collecting appropriate data (i.e., repeated surveys of landscape units within a relatively short timeframe), recently developed statistical models can be used to obtain unbiased parameter estimates.

	abstract = {Resource-selection probability functions and occupancy models are powerful methods of identifying areas within a landscape that are highly used by a species. One common design/analysis method for estimation of a resource-selection probability function is to classify a sample of units as used or unused and estimate the probability of use as a function of independent variables using, for example, logistic regression. This method requires that resource units are correctly classified as unused (i.e., the species is never undetected in a used unit), or that the probability of misclassification is the same for all units. In this paper, I explore these issues, illustrating how misclassifying units as unused may lead to incorrect conclusions about resource use. I also show how recently developed occupancy models can be utilized within the resource-selection context to improve conclusions by explicitly accounting for detection probability. These models require that multiple surveys be conducted at each of a sample of resource units within a relatively short timeframe, but given the growing evidence from simulation studies and field data, I recommend that such procedures should be incorporated into studies of resource use.},

	abstract = {Carnivores have long been used as model organisms to examine mechanisms that allow coexistence among ecologically similar species. Interactions between carnivores, including competition and predation, comprise important processes regulating local community structure and diversity. We use data from an intensive camera-trapping monitoring program across eight Neotropical forest sites to describe the patterns of spatiotemporal organization of a guild of five sympatric cat species: jaguar (Panthera onca), puma (Puma concolor), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi) and margay (Leopardus wiedii). For the three largest cat species, we developed multi-stage occupancy models accounting for habitat characteristics (landscape complexity and prey availability) and models accounting for species interactions (occupancy estimates of potential competitor cat species). Patterns of habitat-use were best explained by prey availability, rather than habitat structure or species interactions, with no evidence of negative associations of jaguar on puma and ocelot occupancy or puma on ocelot occupancy. We further explore temporal activity patterns and overlap of all five felid species. We observed a moderate temporal overlap between jaguar, puma and ocelot, with differences in their activity peaks, whereas higher temporal partitioning was observed between jaguarundi and both ocelot and margay. Lastly, we conducted temporal overlap analysis and calculated species activity levels across study sites to explore if shifts in daily activity within species can be explained by varying levels of local competition pressure. Activity patterns of ocelots, jaguarundis and margays were similarly bimodal across sites, but pumas exhibited irregular activity patterns, most likely as a response to jaguar activity. Activity levels were similar among sites and observed differences were unrelated to competition or intraguild killing risk. Our study reveals apparent spatial and temporal partitioning for most of the species pairs analyzed, with prey abundance being more important than species interactions in governing the local occurrence and spatial distribution of Neotropical forest felids.},

	abstract = {The tropical dry forest is one of the most endangered ecosystems in the world, mainly due to deforestation and fragmentation. In Mexico more than half of its surface has disappeared, affecting biodiversity. The objective of this study was to compare the richness, diversity, and relative abundance of medium and large mammals in two sites with different management and conservation status, and where tropical dry forest is present. We also sought to find out which variables of habitat and human influence are related to the presence of the most common species. The study sites were in Pastorias, Actopan, Veracruz and San Juan Bautista Cuicatlan, Oaxaca, Mexico. The first site is highly transformed by anthropogenic activities, while the second is within the protected natural area of the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Biosphere Reserve (TCBR). In Pastorias 11 camera-traps were set up from september 2015 to september 2016; while in Cuicatlan 10 camera traps were set up from october 2013 to july 2014. The sampling effort was 3526 days/trap which yielded 443 independent records for the first site, and 2690 days/trap that yielded 378 independent records for the second site. In each locality 13 species of mammals were recorded. In particular, three of these species are endangered (Tamandua mexicana, Leopardus wiedii, and Lynx rufus) and two are under threat (Herpailurus yagouaroundi and Galictis vittata). The true diversity of medium and large mammals between communities was different. According to the relative abundance index (RAI) the most abundant species are Odocoileus virginianus, Urocyon cinereoargenteus and Canis latrans. Regression analyses suggest that the variables of season, the cover of secondary vegetation and distance to the nearest human locality are related to the record of these species. Despite the anthropogenic pressure in Pastorias, tropical dry forest remnants still maintain high species richness, which is very similar to that of a site as preserved as Cuicatlan. However, the low RAIs value of several mammals may indicate that habitat quality could not maintain large population numbers. Therefore, it is necessary to develop programs to conserve this ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Activity level (the proportion of time that animals spend active) is a behavioural and ecological metric that can provide an indicator of energetics, foraging effort and exposure to risk. However, activity level is poorly known for free-living animals because it is difficult to quantify activity in the field in a consistent, cost-effective and non-invasive way. This article presents a new method to estimate activity level with time-of-detection data from camera traps (or more generally any remote sensors), fitting a flexible circular distribution to these data to describe the underlying activity schedule, and calculating overall proportion of time active from this. Using simulations and a case study for a range of small- to medium-sized mammal species, we find that activity level can reliably be estimated using the new method. The method depends on the key assumption that all individuals in the sampled population are active at the peak of the daily activity cycle. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting that this assumption is likely to be met for many species, but may be less likely met in large predators, or in high-latitude winters. Further research is needed to establish stronger evidence on the validity of this assumption in specific cases; however, the approach has the potential to provide an effective, non-invasive alternative to existing methods for quantifying population activity levels.},

	abstract = {Although ecology is rife with theory that explores how multiple species co-occur through space and time, the field lacks robust statistical models to parameterize this theory with empirical data, particularly when species are detected imperfectly and data are collected as a time-series. We address this need by developing an occupancy model that estimates local colonization and extinction rates for two or more interacting species when data are collected across multiple sampling occasions. This model estimates how community composition at a site may change across sampling occasions by assuming the latent occupancy state is a categorical random variable. We used a multinomial-logit model to parameterize species specific parameters and pairwise interactions between species, both of which can be made a function of covariates. These transition probabilities between community states can then be converted to occupancy or co-occurrence probabilities to determine how community composition varies along an environmental gradient or through time. As an example, we estimate patterns of co-occurrence between coyote Canis latrans, Virginia opossum Didelphis virginiana, and raccoon Procyon lotor in Chicago, Illinois, USA with data from a multiyear camera trapping study. Models with pairwise interactions between species greatly out performed models that assumed independence between species. Opossum and raccoon, for example, were far less likely to go extinct in habitat patches where coyotes were present. Community composition at a site depends on species interactions and the local environment. Our model can separate such effects by estimating the underlying processes that define species occurrence patterns. As a result, our model can more explicitly quantify a wide range of ecological dynamics and therefore be used to empirically test ecological theory, such as estimating priority effects at a site or turnover rates between species, both of which can be made to vary as a function of covariates.},

	abstract = {Intraguild predation (IGP), that is, feeding interaction between two consumers that share the same resource species, is commonly observed in natural food webs. IGP expands vertical niche space and slows down energy flows from lower to higher trophic levels, which potentially affects the diversity and dynamics of food webs. Here, we use food-web models to investigate the effects of IGP on species diversity and ecosystem functioning. We first simulate a five-species food-web module with different strengths of IGP at the herbivore and/or carnivore level. Results show that as the strength of IGP within a trophic level increases, the biomass of its resource level increases because of predation release; this increased biomass in turn alters the energy fluxes and biomass of other trophic levels. These results are then extended by subsequent simulations of more diverse food webs. As the strength of IGP increases, simulated food webs maintain (1) higher species diversity at different trophic levels, (2) higher total biomasses at different trophic levels, and (3) larger energy fluxes across trophic levels. Our results challenge the intuitive hypothesis that food-web structure should maximize the efficiency of energy transfer across trophic levels; instead, they suggest that the assembly of food webs should be governed by a balance between efficiency (of energy transfer) and persistence (i.e., the maintenance of species and biomasses). Our simulations also show that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (e.g., total biomass or primary production) is much stronger in the presence of IGP, reconciling the contrast from recent studies based on food-chain and food-web models. Our findings shed new light on the functional role of IGP and contribute to resolving the debate on structure, diversity and functioning in complex food webs.},

	abstract = {[The behavioral ecology of coyotes (Canis latrans) on the Welder Wildlife Refuge (WWR), South Texas, was studied from 17,556 telemetry locations of 63 coyotes and 844 visual observations of collared and uncollared coyotes from January 1978 through December 1979 and during May 1980, November 1980, and February 1982. Coyotes on the WWR were classified as 70\% resident groups, 17\% resident pairs, and 13\% transients. Before whelping, each group (3-7 coyotes) consisted of a mated pair and associates. Seven mated pairs interacted frequently, maintained pair bonds for at least 3-20 months, and were most social during the breeding season. Breeders and associates interacted less than breeding pairs, and associates were seldom found with a breeder of the opposite sex if the other breeding individual was absent during the breeding season. Breeders and associates were active around pups, but did not alternate in attending pups. Adult coyote group size was not related to the percentage of time pups were left unattended. The percentage of time pups were together decreased as they matured. Composite home ranges, based on 95\% of the locations, of 19 resident adult males ({\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}overline\{x\}=4.7{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm km\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}) and 14 females ({\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}overline\{x\}=4.3{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm km\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}) were similar. Home ranges of resident adult males and females did not differ within a season or among seasons. Home ranges, based on all locations, averaged {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\$42.8{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm km\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} for 10 male and {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\$31.2{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm km\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} for 11 female adult transients. Home ranges of coyote pups increased as they matured. Coyote pairs and groups occupied primarily contiguous, nonoverlapping home ranges with the larger home ranges of transients superimposed. Four adults were found within the same home range for 43-48 months and 4 pups for 9-29 months. Adult coyote home range areas were not related to group sizes. Annual percentages of emigration were 12-29\% for adult males and 4-9\% for adult females. Percentages of various-sized prey and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in coyote diets varied seasonally and were not related to the number of interacting coyotes living within home ranges nor to the average number of coyotes observed together. Although coyotes were most active during the night, daytime activity was noted. Activity patterns were similar for adult males and females, for residents and transients, and among seasons. Timing of activity periods by adults and pups were similar. Distances moved in 24 hours were similar for adult males (8.1 km) and adult females (7.8 km), and among other social classes, but distances moved were greatest during the breeding season with no relation to group size or foraging ecology. Distances moved by pups increased as they matured and were similar to those of adults during November-December. Five groups produced an average of {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\$0.22{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}text\{litter\}/\{{\textbackslash}rm km\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} during both 1978 and 1979 and an estimated {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\$1.4{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}text\{pups\}/\{{\textbackslash}rm km\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} in 1979. Annual mortality of adults averaged 32\% and was higher for transients (49\%) than residents (18\%). Seven of 11 pups tagged when 1-5 months old died before 7 months of age. The relatively large groups of coyotes on the WWR likely resulted from habitat saturation and lack of human exploitation.]},

I argue that it is useful to define Grinnellian and Eltonian niches on the basis of the types of variables used to calculate them, the natural spatial scale at which they can be measured, and the dispersal of the individuals over the environment. I use set theory notation and analogies derived from population ecology theory to obtain formal definitions of areas of distribution and several types of niches.

	abstract = {Estimating actual and potential areas of distribution of species via ecological niche modeling has become a very active field of research, yet important conceptual issues in this field remain confused. We argue that conceptual clarity is enhanced by adopting restricted definitions of "niche" that enable operational definitions of basic concepts like fundamental, potential, and realized niches and potential and actual distributional areas. We apply these definitions to the question of niche conservatism, addressing what it is that is conserved and showing with a quantitative example how niche change can be measured. In this example, we display the extremely irregular structure of niche space, arguing that it is an important factor in understanding niche evolution. Many cases of apparently successful models of distributions ignore biotic factors: we suggest explanations to account for this paradox. Finally, relating the probability of observing a species to ecological factors, we address the issue of what objects are actually calculated by different niche modeling algorithms and stress the fact that methods that use only presence data calculate very different quantities than methods that use absence data. We conclude that the results of niche modeling exercises can be interpreted much better if the ecological and mathematical assumptions of the modeling process are made explicit.},

	abstract = {Biotic interactions can influence the ranges and abundances of species, but no clear guidelines exist for integrating them into correlative models of niches and distributions. Niche/distributional models characterize environmental/habitat suitability or species presence using predictor variables unaffected by (= unlinked to) the population of the focal species. Such variables (termed ‘scenopoetic’) typically have been considered to include only abiotic factors. In contrast, population–demographic approaches model the abundance of the focal species by including linked predictor variables, which frequently are biotic interactors. Nevertheless, a focal species might hold no, or negligible, population-level effects on its biotic interactors. Hence, contrary to current theory, such interactors would represent unlinked variables valid and potentially very useful for niche/distributional models. Consideration of population-level effects indicates that facilitators and affecting amensals (species that negatively affect another species but are not affected by it) constitute unlinked variables, but commensals and affected amensals do not. For competitors, mutualists, predators/prey, consumers/resources, and parasites/hosts, additional information is necessary. Specifically, available ecological/natural history information for the particular species involved (e.g. regarding specificity) and theory regarding ecological networks can allow identification of interactors that are likely to be unlinked or nearly so. Including an unlinked biotic interactor as a predictor variable in a niche/distributional model should improve predictions when the effects of the biotic interactor vary across the study region, or in another place or time period. Other relevant interactors must be taken into account by post-processing a niche/distributional model, or via population–demographic models that require abundance data over time. This framework should improve current correlative models and highlights areas requiring progress.},

	abstract = {A central tenet of ecology and biogeography is that the broad outlines of species ranges are determined by climate, whereas the effects of biotic interactions are manifested at local scales. While the first proposition is supported by ample evidence, the second is still a matter of controversy. To address this question, we develop a mathematical model that predicts the spatial overlap, i.e. co-occurrence, between pairs of species subject to all possible types of interactions. We then identify the scale of resolution in which predicted range overlaps are lost. We found that co-occurrence arising from positive interactions, such as mutualism (+/+) and commensalism (+/0), are manifested across scales. Negative interactions, such as competition (−/−) and amensalism (−/0), generate checkerboard patterns of co-occurrence that are discernible at finer resolutions but that are lost and increasing scales of resolution. Scale dependence in consumer–resource interactions (+/−) depends on the strength of positive dependencies between species. If the net positive effect is greater than the net negative effect, then interactions scale up similarly to positive interactions. Our results challenge the widely held view that climate alone is sufficient to characterize species distributions at broad scales, but also demonstrate that the spatial signature of competition is unlikely to be discernible beyond local and regional scales.},

	abstract = {A fundamental goal of ecology is to understand the determinants of species' distributions (i.e., the set of locations where a species is present). Competition among species (i.e., interactions among species that harms each of the species involved) is common in nature and it would be tremendously useful to quantify its effects on species' distributions. An approach to studying the large-scale effects of competition or other biotic interactions is to fit species' distributions models (SDMs) and assess the effect of competitors on the distribution and abundance of the species of interest. It is often difficult to validate the accuracy of this approach with available data. Here, we simulate virtual species that experience competition. In these simulated datasets, we can unambiguously identify the effects that competition has on a species' distribution. We then fit SDMs to the simulated datasets and test whether we can use the outputs of the SDMs to infer the true effect of competition in each simulated dataset. In our simulations, the abiotic environment influenced the effects of competition. Thus, our SDMs often inferred that the abiotic environment was a strong predictor of species abundance, even when the species' distribution was strongly affected by competition. The severity of this problem depended on whether the competitor excluded the focal species from highly suitable sites or marginally suitable sites. Our results highlight how correlations between biotic interactions and the abiotic environment make it difficult to infer the effects of competition using SDMs.},

A major source of uncertainty in these models is the role of interactions among species (hereafter biotic interactions). Unfortunately, it is difficult to directly study this problem at large spatial scales and we lack a clear understanding of when biotic interactions shape species' distributions. We show a simple, direct link between the ease of species' coexistence and the importance of competition for shaping species' distributions. We show that increasing the ease of species' coexistence reduces the influence of biotic interactions. Changing the spatial scale of the analysis can reduce the influence of species interactions, but only when it promotes regional coexistence. Using these ideas, we analyze the conditions under which biotic interactions alter species' distributions in a Lotka–Volterra model of competition along an environmental gradient and argue that coexistence theory, rather than scale alone, provides a guide to the influence of species interactions. Our results provide a guide to the facets of biotic interactions that are necessary to anticipate their effects on species distributions.

	abstract = {There is considerable debate about the role of competition in shaping species distributions over broad spatial extents. This debate has practical implications because predicting changes in species' geographic ranges in response to ongoing environmental change would be simpler if competition could be ignored. While this debate has been the subject of many reviews, recent literature has not addressed the rates of relevant processes. This omission is surprising in that ecologists hypothesized decades ago that regional competitive exclusion is a slow process. The goal of this review is to reassess the debate under the hypothesis that competitive exclusion over broad spatial extents is a slow process. Available evidence, including simulations presented for the first time here, suggests that competitive exclusion over broad spatial extents occurs slowly over temporal extents of many decades to millennia. Ecologists arguing against an important role for competition frequently study modern patterns and/or range dynamics over periods of decades, while much of the evidence for competition shaping geographic ranges at broad spatial extents comes from paleoecological studies over time scales of centuries or longer. If competition is slow, as evidence suggests, the geographic distributions of some, perhaps many species, would continue to change over time scales of decades to millennia, even if environmental conditions did not continue to change. If the distributions of competing species are at equilibrium it is possible to predict species distributions based on observed species–environment relationships. However, disequilibrium is widespread as a result of competition and many other processes. Studies whose goal is accurate predictions over intermediate time scales (decades to centuries) should focus on factors associated with range expansion (colonization) and loss (local extinction), as opposed to current patterns. In general, understanding of modern range dynamics would be enhanced by considering the rates of relevant processes.},

Now, ecological-niche models of species’ potential distributions present a possible approach to testing for the geographic patterns predicted under competitive exclusion and competitive release. Previously, we modeled the potential distributions of two spiny pocket mice (Heteromys australis and H. anomalus) in northwestern South America using specimen localities, environmental data, and the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). Here we superimpose the models to examine known distributional records in areas of potential sympatry between the two species, thus testing the geographic predictions of competitive exclusion. In addition, we examine environmental characteristics of known localities, testing for data consistent with competitive release. Areas of potential sympatry are minimal, lying in regions of intermediate water balance. Only records of H. australis are known from areas of potential sympatry in regions where the species’ ranges meet, consistent with exclusion of H. anomalus by H. australis. Heteromys anomalus inhabits areas ecologically suitable for both species only in the isolated Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, in which H. australis is not present (most likely for historical reasons). Furthermore, environmental characteristics of localities of H. anomalus in biogeographic regions where H. australis is absent fit the pattern predicted under competitive release. In contrast, localities of H. australis show no indication of competitive release. Although the results of present analyses do not conclusively demonstrate competitive exclusion or release, they provide directional hypotheses that can now be tested in experimental field and laboratory studies.},

	abstract = {Bobcats are opportunistic felids occurring in a diverse range of habitats and with a widespread distribution from southern Canada to southern Mexico. To explore why the bobcat's distribution stops at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, we modelled the ecological niches, projected as potential distributions, of the felid community (bobcat Lynx rufus, puma Puma concolor, jaguar Panthera onca, margay Leopardus wiedii, jaguarundi Herpailurus yagouaroundi, and ocelot Leopardus pardalis) in southern Mexico, using occurrence data, environmental maps, the computer algorithm GARP, and a GIS platform. The resulting geographical projection of the ecological niche of bobcats extends south of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, suggesting that ecological conditions exist for the establishment of populations. The overlap of the modelled distribution of the bobcat was large with that of the puma (97\%), but low with that of the ocelot (44\%), margay (46\%), jaguar (49\%), and jaguarundi (52\%), the latter three having relatively similar size and feeding habits to bobcats. Moreover, an independent analysis computing a geographic co-occurrence index showed a similar trend of geographic avoidance (values {\textless}−4.60 showing a statistically significant anti-correlation) between bobcats with the margay, ocelot, jaguarundi, and jaguar, but not with the puma (values {\textgreater}0.15), while all felids, except bobcats, showed a geographic co-occurrence in southern Mexico (values ranging from −1.91 to 4.71). The Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a lowland region with subtropical habitat, is unlikely to serve as a geographic and ecological barrier to bobcats. As mammal inventories have been conducted for over a century in this region with no records of bobcats, it is unlikely that bobcats are present but have just not been seen. Fossil records also provide no support for the presence of bobcats in that region in the past. Thus, competitive interactions with other felid species appear important in limiting the southern distribution of bobcats, preventing dispersal to a suitable but geographically reduced area south of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.},

Both subfamilies are partially allopatric in Eurasia, but in North America only Soricinae is present, thus providing a scenario to address the role of potential competition versus competitive release in determining species’ realized distributions at a global scale. Location Global. Taxon Soricidae, Eulipotyphla. Methods We obtained climate data from WorldClim, spatial range data for 302 species from the IUCN Red List and 2614 cytb complete sequences from GenBank. We modelled the potential distribution of the subfamilies by computing three environmental niche models using Maxent: one for Crocidurinae, one for American Soricinae and one for Afro-Eurasian Soricinae. We created matrices for the genetic, spatial and climatic distance between all pairs of species to calculate the average climatic distance between pairs of species within and between subfamilies. We then evaluated this distance against a null model. To assess the effect of phylogeny on the segregation of the subfamilies, we checked for correlation between genetic and spatial distance. Results The Afro-Eurasian Soricinae environmental niche model under-predicted its occurrence in America. The average climatic distance between subfamilies was larger than expected by chance, while the distance within both Crocidurinae and Afro-Eurasian Soricinae was smaller. The average distance between the American and Afro-Eurasian Soricinae was also larger than expected. There was no correlation between spatial and genetic distance for genetic distances over 0.14 substitutions per nucleotide site. Main conclusions Climate significantly influences the distribution of both subfamilies. As expected in a scenario of competitive release, the climatic range of the Soricinae in America is larger than in Afro-Eurasia.

We propose a statistical framework to describe and compare environmental niches from occurrence and spatial environmental data. Location Europe, North America and South America. Methods The framework applies kernel smoothers to densities of species occurrence in gridded environmental space to calculate metrics of niche overlap and test hypotheses regarding niche conservatism. We use this framework and simulated species with pre-defined distributions and amounts of niche overlap to evaluate several ordination and species distribution modelling techniques for quantifying niche overlap. We illustrate the approach with data on two well-studied invasive species. Results We show that niche overlap can be accurately detected with the framework when variables driving the distributions are known. The method is robust to known and previously undocumented biases related to the dependence of species occurrences on the frequency of environmental conditions that occur across geographical space. The use of a kernel smoother makes the process of moving from geographical space to multivariate environmental space independent of both sampling effort and arbitrary choice of resolution in environmental space. However, the use of ordination and species distribution model techniques for selecting, combining and weighting variables on which niche overlap is calculated provide contrasting results. Main conclusions The framework meets the increasing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences. It is appropriate for studying niche differences between species, subspecies or intra-specific lineages that differ in their geographical distributions. Alternatively, it can be used to measure the degree to which the environmental niche of a species or intra-specific lineage has changed over time.},

The mortality rates of adult foxes were independent of population density. Second, populations of kit foxes are bounded by their territorial spacing behavior, which limits recruitment at high densities. These regulatory factors may operate in concert to curtail population growth at high densities, whereas decreased juvenile mortality by coyotes can operate independently to increase population growth at low densities. Despite the presence of these strong regulating factors, density-independent variations in reproductive rates often result in population crashes or irruptions that are the fundamental causes of instability in populations of ki..., Nous avons évalué les données accumulées au cours d'études sur le terrain pour identifier les facteurs qui régissent ou influencent fortement la dynamique des populations de Renards nains. Deux mécanismes régulateurs influencés par la densité ont été reconnus. D'abord, le taux de recrutement d'individus juvéniles est inversement proportionnel à la densité des renards adultes puisqu'une proportion plus élevée de juvéniles sont tués par les coyotes lorsque les densités de renards sont plus élevées. Les taux de mortalité des renards adultes ne dépendent pas de la densité de la population. En second lieu, les populations de Renards nains sont limitées par le comportement territorial d'espacement des animaux, facteur qui restreint le recrutement à des densités élevées. Ces facteurs de régulation peuvent agir de concert pour inhiber la croissance de la population aux densités élevées, alors que la mortalité moins grande des juvéniles sous la pression de prédation des coyotes peu agir indépendamment pour favoris...},

	abstract = {Variation in kit fox (Vulpes macrotis) population parameters can be influenced by vegetative cover and the distribution and abundance of other predator and prey species. Dramatic changes to Great Basin Desert habitats, which can potentially impact mammalian species, have occurred in some areas in Utah. We examined kit fox demographics and prey populations from 1999 to 2001 on Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), a U.S. Army facility in Utah, and compared some parameters to historical levels (1956–1958–1966–1969). Adult survival rates were fairly consistent between 1999 and 2000 and between 1999 and 2001; however, survival was greater in 2001 than in 2000. Reproductive rates ranged from 1.0 to 3.8 pups per female in 1999–2000 and were similar to historical numbers (1.0–4.2 pups per female). We found a decrease in pre-whelping kit fox density from the 1960s (0.12 foxes · km−2) to 1999–2001 (0.04 foxes · km−2); however, densities were similar between the current study and the 1950s (0.08 foxes · km−2). Using 9 years of data, we found density dependence between reproductive rates of the current year and annual fox density from the previous year. Using 7 years of data, we found a slight correlation between kit fox annual density and a 1-year lag in leporid abundance, even though leporid abundance was lower during the present study than it was historically. Compared to historical levels, current small mammal abundance and species composition has changed in several habitats. Kit fox breeding density and annual density were inversely correlated with coyote (Canis latrans) density. Changes to the landscape at DPG, especially due to invasion of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and addition of artificial water sources, have caused a change in available kit fox habitat and prey species, and have increased the abundance of coyotes, the kit fox's major competitor.},

	abstract = {Understanding and accurately modeling species distributions lies at the heart of many problems in ecology, evolution, and conservation. Multiple sources of data are increasingly available for modeling species distributions, such as data from citizen science programs, atlases, museums, and planned surveys. Yet reliably combining data sources can be challenging because data sources can vary considerably in their design, gradients covered, and potential sampling biases. We review, synthesize and illustrate recent developments in combining multiple sources of data for species distribution modeling. We identify five ways in which multiple sources of data are typically combined for modeling species distributions. These approaches vary in their ability to accommodate sampling design, bias, and uncertainty when quantifying environmental relationships in species distribution models. Many of the challenges for combining data are solved through the prudent use of integrated species distribution models: models that simultaneously combine different data sources on species locations to quantify environmental relationships for explaining species distribution. We illustrate these approaches using planned survey data on 24 species of birds coupled with opportunistically collected eBird data in the southeastern United States. This example illustrates some of the benefits of data integration, such as increased precision in environmental relationships, greater predictive accuracy, and accounting for sample bias. Yet it also illustrates challenges of combining data sources with vastly different sampling methodologies and amounts of data. We provide one solution to this challenge through the use of weighted joint likelihoods. Weighted joint likelihoods provide a means to emphasize data sources based on different criteria (e.g., sample size) and we find that weighting improves predictions for all species considered. We conclude by providing practical guidance on combining multiple sources of data for modeling species distributions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Coarse-scale models typically use information-poor (e.g., presence-only) data to predict relative distributions across geographic ranges, whereas fine-scale models often use richer information (e.g., presence–absence data) to predict distributions at local to landscape scales.ObjectivesWe unite presence–absence and presence-only data to predict occurrence of species, what we refer to as integrated distribution models. We determine if integrated models improve predictions of species distributions and identification of characteristic spatial scales of environmental relationships relative to presence–absence modeling and ensemble modeling that averages predictions from separate presence-only and presence–absence models.MethodsWe apply recent advances in integrated distribution models to predict Sherman’s fox squirrel (Sciurus niger shermani) distribution in north-central Florida. Presence-only data were collected through a citizen-science program across its geographic range, while presence–absence data were collected using camera trapping surveys across 40 landscapes.ResultsIntegrated models estimated environmental relationships with greater precision and identified larger characteristic scales for environmental relationships than using presence–absence data alone. In addition, integrated models tended to have greater predictive performance, which was more robust to the amount of presence–absence and presence-only data used in modeling, than presence–absence and ensemble models.ConclusionsIntegrated distribution models hold much potential for improving our understanding of environmental relationships, the scales at which environmental relationships operate, and providing more accurate predictions of species distributions. Many avenues exist for further advancement of these modeling approaches.},

	abstract = {Top-down processes, via the direct and indirect effects of interspecific competitive killing (no consumption of the kill) or intraguild predation (consumption of the kill), can potentially influence the spatial distribution of terrestrial predators, but few studies have demonstrated the phenomenon at a continental scale. For example, in North America, grey wolves Canis lupus are known to kill coyotes Canis latrans, and coyotes, in turn, may kill foxes Vulpes spp., but the spatial effects of these competitive interactions at large scales are unknown. Here, we analyse fur return data across eight jurisdictions in North America to test whether the presence or absence of wolves has caused a continent-wide shift in coyote and red fox Vulpes vulpes density. Our results support the existence of a continental scale cascade whereby coyotes outnumber red foxes in areas where wolves have been extirpated by humans, whereas red foxes outnumber coyotes in areas where wolves are present. However, for a distance of up to 200 km on the edge of wolf distribution, there is a transition zone where the effects of top-down control are weakened, possibly due to the rapid dispersal and reinvasion capabilities of coyotes into areas where wolves are sporadically distributed or at low densities. Our results have implications for understanding how the restoration of wolf populations across North America could potentially affect co-occurring predators and prey. We conclude that large carnivores may need to occupy large continuous areas to facilitate among-carnivore cascades and that studies of small areas may not be indicative of the effects of top-down mesopredator control.},

However, such studies are often undertaken after populations are in decline or under interspecific stress. Since habitat selection is not independent of interspecific stress, quantifying an animal's current landscape use could be misleading if the species distribution is suboptimal. We present an alternative approach by modeling the predicted distributions of two sympatric species on the landscape using dietary preferences and prey distribution. We compared the observed habitat use of kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis) and coyotes (Canis latrans) against their predicted distribution. Data included locations of kit foxes and coyotes, carnivore scat transects, and seasonal prey surveys. Although habitats demonstrated heterogeneity with respect to prey resources, only coyotes showed habitat use designed to maximize access to prey. In contrast, kit foxes used habitats which did not align closely with prey resources. Instead, habitat use by kit foxes represented spatial and behavioral strategies designed to minimize spatial overlap with coyotes while maximizing access to resources. Data on the distribution of prey, their dietary importance, and the species-specific disparities between predicted and observed habitat distributions supports a mechanism by which kit fox distribution is derived from intense competitive interactions with coyotes.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic modifications to landscapes intended to benefit wildlife may negatively influence wildlife communities. Anthropogenic provisioning of free water (water developments) to enhance abundance and distribution of wildlife is a common management practice in arid regions where water is limiting. Despite the long-term and widespread use of water developments, little is known about how they influence native species. Water developments may negatively influence arid-adapted species (e.g., kit fox, Vulpes macrotis) by enabling water-dependent competitors (e.g., coyote, Canis latrans) to expand distribution in arid landscapes (i.e., indirect effect of water hypothesis). We tested the two predictions of the indirect effect of water hypothesis (i.e., coyotes will visit areas with free water more frequently and kit foxes will spatially and temporally avoid coyotes) and evaluated relative use of free water by canids in the Great Basin and Mojave Deserts from 2010 to 2012. We established scent stations in areas with (wet) and without (dry) free water and monitored visitation by canids to these sites and visitation to water sources using infrared-triggered cameras. There was no difference in the proportions of visits to scent stations in wet or dry areas by coyotes or kit foxes at either study area. We did not detect spatial (no negative correlation between visits to scent stations) or temporal (no difference between times when stations were visited) segregation between coyotes and kit foxes. Visitation to water sources was not different for coyotes between study areas, but kit foxes visited water sources more in Mojave than Great Basin. Our results did not support the indirect effect of water hypothesis in the Great Basin or Mojave Deserts for these two canids.},

	abstract = {Coyotes, which originate from central and southwestern North America, recently extended their range into forests of the Northeast. Forest coyotes occur in lower densities, have lower body reserves, and consume more fruits during summer than their counterparts occupying adjacent rural landscapes. We hypothesised that the forest landscape offered less animal prey to coyotes during summer than did the rural landscape. Coyote densities were higher in the rural landscape (2.7 animals 10 km-2) than in the forest landscape (0.5 animals 10 km-2) during the summer of 1997. During the summers of 1996 and 1997, coyotes in both landscapes fed mainly on wildberries ({\textless} 45\% of dry matter intake), small mammals ({\textless} 10\%), and snowshoe hare ({\textless} 10\%). The biomass of the most abundant animal prey, snowshoe hares, was greater in the forest landscape (1.24 and 1.53 kg ha-1 in 1996 and 1997, respectively) than in the rural landscape (0.46 and 0.40 kg ha-1 in corresponding years). The biomass of the other major animal prey (small mammals), was comparable in both landscapes but irrupted during the second summer (0.09 and 0.50 kg ha-1 in 1996 and 1997, respectively). The biomass of fruits remained relatively constant in the rural landscape during the summers of 1996 and 1997 (ª 6 kg ha-1), but it tripled in the forest landscape during the second year (1.69 kg ha-1 in 1996 versus 5.30 kg ha-1 in 1997). Contrary to our prediction, the availability of animal prey in the forest landscape exceeded that in the rural landscape. Our results illustrate that the presence of prey does not correspond to its availability to predators. Coyotes appear poorly adapted for hunting in dense forest vegetation during summer and compensate for shortage of animal prey by consuming more berries.},

Our objective was to determine whether differences between urban and exurban environments, particularly food availability and disease vectors, were reflected in kit fox condition. Body mass, blood chemistry, and prevalence of viral antibodies were assessed at both sites in 1988 and 1989. Body mass was higher for BAK kit foxes, particularly juveniles, and varied between years for NPRC kit foxes. Higher red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) among NPRC kit foxes were indicative of hemoconcentration, probably resulting from dehydration associated with low food or water intake. Kit foxes from NPRC exhibited higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and lower cholesterol (CHOL) levels compared to BAK kit foxes. These results may have reflected dietary differences, but they possibly indicated tissue catabolism by NPRC kit foxes due to nutritional deprivation. Other serological data also suggested nutritional stress among NPRC kit foxes. Prevalence of antibodies to canine parvovirus (CPV), canine distemper (CD), and infectious canine hepatitus (ICH) was similar between populations. Food availability for kit foxes at NPRC was relatively low during 1988-89 due to drought conditions, but food probably was not a limiting factor at BAK due to abundant water and the presence of anthropogenic foods. Urban environments may provide certain advantages for San Joaquin kit foxes and could contribute to conservation and recovery efforts.]},

Increasing coyote (Canis latrans Say, 1823) abundance and subsequent intraguild interactions may be one cause for this decline. Concurrent monitoring of carnivores is challenging and therefore rarely conducted. One possible solution for monitoring elusive carnivores is using noninvasive genetic sampling. We used noninvasive genetic sampling to collect fecal DNA from kit foxes and coyotes and estimate their densities from 2013–2014 in Utah, USA. We identified individuals based on microsatellite genotypes and estimated density with multisession spatially explicit capture–recapture models. Mean kit fox density was 0.02 foxes·km−2, while coyote densities were up to four times greater (0.07–0.08 coyotes·km−2). Kit fox densities were significantly lower than densities in the 1950s but were comparable with estimates from the late 1990s, suggesting that populations may be stabilizing after a precipitous decline. Our kit fox density estimates were among the lowest documented for the species. Our coyote density estimate was the first reported in our region and revealed that despite seemingly high abundance, densities are low compared with other regions. Our results suggested that kit foxes may be able to coexist with coyotes.},

We assessed diet patterns of coyotes over a 5-year period (2009–14) in a region of the Mojave Desert where high predation rates on threatened desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) had been reported. Our goal was to identify primary food items for coyotes and to assess the importance of desert tortoises in the diet. Coyotes primarily consumed rabbits and rodents with rabbits being consumed preferentially and rodents, along with secondary foods including various birds, reptiles, arthropods, and fruits, being consumed more opportunistically. In response to low annual precipitation in the last three years of the study, dietary diversity increased, as did use of anthropogenic food items by coyotes. However, coyotes did not seem to be dependent upon anthropogenic items. Remains of desert tortoises occurred in coyote scats at low frequencies ({\textless}6\%) in all years and seasons, and use of tortoises appeared to be opportunistic as use varied with tortoise abundance. In the portion of the study area where 571 translocated desert tortoises had been released in 2008, the frequencies of tortoise remains in coyote scats were markedly higher in the two years following the releases (7.5\% and 8.8\%, respectively). The high predation rates on tortoises reported in this area may have resulted from focussed coyote foraging efforts due to the availability of vulnerable individuals (e.g. disoriented and displaced tortoises) as well as higher tortoise densities.},

The effect of bait on animal movement and space-use, however, is contested, fueled by concerns bait may affect animal movement and increase residency time. If founded, bait may bias parameter estimates from density, species distribution, resource selection, or behavioral models, produce spurious ecological inferences, and skew resulting management recommendations. To test whether animal movement varies with proximity to bait, we used high-resolution global positioning system telemetry data of 10 fishers (Pekania pennanti), temporally paired with 64 baited wildlife camera traps, to quantify the effect of bait on individual and population movement metrics. Although bait appeared to have a significant correlative effect on 1-hour movement segments, landscape characteristics had an effect 1.7 times greater, where the proportion of mixed forest and cultivation explained the majority of variability in animal movements. We contend that maximizing probability of detection and controlling or modeling local-scale landscape variability that could affect the probability of detection is a more important consideration in wildlife research than the effect of bait, which is eclipsed by differences incurred by natural habitat heterogeneity. Failing to maximize the probability of detection may obscure the modest bias potentially presented by the use of bait, or attractants, on ecological inference. © 2019 The Wildlife Society},

This paper presents an application of object-oriented techniques for habitat classification based on remotely sensed images and ancillary data. The study reports the results of habitat mapping at multiple scales using Earth Observation (EO) data at various spatial resolutions and multi temporal acquisition dates. We investigate the role of object texture and context in classification as well as the value of integrating knowledge from ancillary data sources. Habitat maps were produced at regional and local scales in two case studies; Schleswig-Holstein, Germany and Wye Downs, United Kingdom. At the regional scale, the main task was the development of a consistent object-oriented classification scheme that is transferable to satellite images for other years. This is demonstrated for a time series of Landsat TM/ETM+ scenes. At the local scale, investigations focus on the development of appropriate object-oriented rule networks for the detailed mapping of habitats, e.g. dry grasslands and wetlands using very high resolution satellite and airborne scanner images. The results are evaluated using statistical accuracy assessment and visual comparison with traditional field-based habitat maps. Whereas the application of traditional pixel-based classification result in a pixelised (salt and pepper) representation of land cover, the object-based classification technique result in solid habitat objects allowing easy integration into a vector-GIS for further analysis. The level of detail obtained at the local scale is comparable to that achieved by visual interpretation of aerial photographs or field-based mapping and also retains spatially explicit, fine scale information such as scrub encroachment or ecotone patterns within habitats.},

Based on differential responses to cues, three hypotheses have been proposed to explain spatial variation in vigilance behavior. The predator-vigilance hypothesis proposes that prey increase vigilance where there is evidence of predators. The visibility-vigilance hypothesis suggests that prey increase vigilance where visibility is obstructed. Alternatively, the refuge-vigilance hypothesis proposes that prey may perceive areas with low visibility (greater cover) as refuges and decrease vigilance. We evaluated support for these hypotheses using the kit fox (Vulpes macrotis), a solitary carnivore subject to intraguild predation, as a model. From 2010 to 2012, we used infrared-triggered cameras to record video of kit fox behavior at water sources in Utah, USA. The refuge-vigilance hypothesis explained more variation in vigilance behavior of kit foxes than the other two hypotheses (AICc model weight=0.37). Kit foxes were less vigilant at water sources with low overhead cover (refuge) obstructing visibility. Based on our results, the predator-vigilance and visibility-vigilance hypotheses may not be applicable to all species of prey. Solitary prey, unlike gregarious prey, may use areas with concealing cover to maximize resource acquisition and minimize vigilance.},

Alternatively, historical samples can provide insights into changes in genetic diversity and effective population size (Ne). Kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis) are a species of conservation concern across much of their range. In western Utah, kit fox abundance has declined precipitously from historical levels, causing concern about population persistence. We analyzed genetic samples from museum specimens and contemporary scats to evaluate temporal changes in (a) genetic diversity and (b) Ne for kit foxes in western Utah, and (c) discuss our findings with respect to population risk and conservation. The Ne of kit foxes in western Utah has decreased substantially. When compared to established conservation thresholds for Ne (e.g., the 50/500 rule), observed levels suggest the population may be at risk of inbreeding depression and local extinction. In contrast, we found no significant decrease in genetic diversity associated with declining Ne. We detected evidence of low levels of immigration into the population and suspect genetic diversity may have been maintained by this previously undescribed gene flow from adjacent populations. Low or intermittent immigration may serve to temper the potential short-term negative consequences of low Ne. We recommend that kit fox conservation efforts focus on evaluating and maintaining landscape connectivity. We demonstrate how historical specimens can provide a baseline of comparison for contemporary populations, highlighting the importance of natural history collections to conservation during a period of declining funding and support.},

Yet, many natural IGP systems robustly persist. Standard models of intraguild predation simplify natural systems in crucial ways that could influence persistence; in particular, many empirical IGP systems are embedded in communities with alternative prey species. We briefly review the key conclusions of standard three-species IGP theory, and then present results of theoretical explorations of how alternative prey can influence the persistence and stability of a focal intraguild predation interaction.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem services are the benefits obtained from the environment that increase human well-being. Economic valuation is conducted by measuring the human welfare gains or losses that result from changes in the provision of ecosystem services. Bats have long been postulated to play important roles in arthropod suppression, seed dispersal, and pollination; however, only recently have these ecosystem services begun to be thoroughly evaluated. Here, we review the available literature on the ecological and economic impact of ecosystem services provided by bats. We describe dietary preferences, foraging behaviors, adaptations, and phylogenetic histories of insectivorous, frugivorous, and nectarivorous bats worldwide in the context of their respective ecosystem services. For each trophic ensemble, we discuss the consequences of these ecological interactions on both natural and agricultural systems. Throughout this review, we highlight the research needed to fully determine the ecosystem services in question. Finally, we provide a comprehensive overview of economic valuation of ecosystem services. Unfortunately, few studies estimating the economic value of ecosystem services provided by bats have been conducted to date; however, we outline a framework that could be used in future studies to more fully address this question. Consumptive goods provided by bats, such as food and guano, are often exchanged in markets where the market price indicates an economic value. Nonmarket valuation methods can be used to estimate the economic value of nonconsumptive services, including inputs to agricultural production and recreational activities. Information on the ecological and economic value of ecosystem services provided by bats can be used to inform decisions regarding where and when to protect or restore bat populations and associated habitats, as well as to improve public perception of bats.},

They have great advantage and disadvantage in economic terms. The economic benefits obtained from bats include biological pest control, plant pollination, seed dispersal, guano mining, bush meat and medicine, aesthetic and bat watching tourism, and education and research. Even though bats are among gentle animals providing many positive ecological and economic benefits, few species have negative effects. They cause damage on human, livestock, agricultural crops, building, and infrastructure. They also cause airplane strike, disease transmission, and contamination, and bite humans during self-defense. Bat populations appear to be declining presumably in response to human induced environmental stresses like habitat destruction and fragmentation, disturbance to caves, depletion of food resources, overhunting for bush meat and persecution, increased use of pesticides, infectious disease, and wind energy turbine. As bats are among the most overlooked in spite of their economical and ecological importance, their conservation is mandatory.},

	abstract = {Discussion of successional change has traditionally focused on plants. The role of animals in producing and responding to successional change has received far less attention. Dispersal of plant propagules by animals is a fundamental part of successional change in the tropics. Here we review the role played by frugivorous bats in successional change in tropical forests. We explore the similarities and differences of this ecological service provided by New and Old World seed-dispersing bats and conclude with a discussion of their current economic and conservation implications. Our review suggests that frugivorous New World phyllostomid bats play a more important role in early plant succession than their Old World pteropodid counterparts. We propose that phyllostomid bats have shared a long evolutionary history with small-seeded early successional shrubs and treelets while pteropodid bats are principally dispersers of the seeds of later successional canopy fruits. When species of figs (Ficus) are involved in the early stages of primary succession (e.g. in the river meander system in Amazonia and on Krakatau, Indonesia), both groups of bats are important contributors of propagules. Because they disperse and sometimes pollinate canopy trees, pteropodid bats have a considerable impact on the economic value of Old World tropical forests; phyllostomid bats appear to make a more modest direct contribution to the economic value of New World tropical forests. Nonetheless, because they critically influence forest regeneration, phyllostomid bats make an important indirect contribution to the economic value of these forests. Overall, fruit-eating bats play important roles in forest regeneration throughout the tropics, making their conservation highly desirable.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Genetic data hypothetically place the origin of the most recent common ancestor of the subfamily Emballonurinae in Africa, suggesting a dispersal event from Africa to South America during the Oligocene (30 Ma), and a subsequent allopatric radiation in the New World. Emballonurid genera exist in Central America where, to date, only one event of diversification has been documented for Balantiopteryx before the completion of the Isthmus of Panama land connection in the Pliocene.Methods: Emballonurid bats constitutes an important element of the bat fauna in Colombia. Herein, museum voucher specimens were used as primary source to generate a checklist of emballonurid bats from Colombia. In addition, selected museum voucher specimens were analyzed to verify their identifications. The checklist is accompanied by references as well as models of potential distribution for each Colombian emballonurid species. These distribution maps were used to investigate the affinities, in species composition, among Colombian ecoregions as outlined by Hernández-Camacho et al. (1992), and to determine emballonurid richness distribution in Colombia and the relationship between environmental variables and patterns of species richness in this group of bats in the country.Results: We report 16 confirmed emballonurid bat species for Colombia and three species potentially present in the country, for a total of 19 species representing the eight recognized Neotropical emballonurid genera. At 16 known species, Colombia has the second greatest number of Neotropical emballonurid bats after Brazil (17 spp.).Discussion and conclusion: The checklist presented herein is accompanied by 11 taxonomic and distributional comments explaining recent changes in taxonomy, species distribution rearrangements, as well as clarifications and a refinement of the previous records for Colombia. In addition, Geographic Information System (GIS) models of potential distribution were created for all confirmed species in Colombia, and species richness patterns were analyzed. Finally, in a Parsimony Analysis of Endemism was performed for Colombian emballonurids we found that diversity within this group of bats in geographically subdivided in Colombia into four main regions including: The Biogeographic Chocó; the Magdalena Valley; The Orinoquia; and the Guianan-Amazon region.Key words: Chiropterans, Parsimony Analysis of Endemism, sheath-tailed bats, sac-wing bats, distribution maps.},

	abstract = {The ecology of bat assemblages in savanna ecosystems is poorly known. Studies on this subject are scarce in the Colombian Orinoquía; some authors have argued that this region shows a low diversity of bat species relative to other natural regions of Colombia, which contrasts with reports for other Neotropical savannas. In order to broaden the knowledge about bat assemblages in savanna ecosystems in Colombia, we evaluated the alpha (local) and beta (species turnover) diversities in three savanna ecosystems located in Colombian alluvial flood plains of Orinoco Llanos , as compared to other natural regions of Colombia. We sampled bat assemblages across three alluvial floodplain savannas: E1) Mosaic of floodplain savannas and floodplain forests covering less than 20 \% of the original area. E2) Dense high forest growing on the flood plains of Whitewater Andean rivers. E3) Aeolian savannas. Mist nets were used in the understory in all cases. We evaluated the representativeness of samples using the Jackknife 1 estimator. The species richness found was compared with the one reported in representative inventories of other natural regions of Colombia. Differences in alpha diversity between the three ecosystems studied were explored by comparing rank-abundance curves and three true-diversity values (q0, q1 and q2). Finally, we evaluated the species turnover across ecosystems using the Jaccard similarity index. A total of 50 bat species were recorded at the regional level, and between 32 and 39 species in each of the ecosystems, representing a greater or similar richness vs other natural regions of Colombia. Sampling representativeness was higher than 80 \%. Although no differences were observed in terms of species richness (q0) between localities, differences were evident in the structure of assemblages (q1, q2). Finally, the species turnover between localities was high, with similarity values between 57 \% and 64 \%. The species richness recorded in the assemblages studied here is similar to that reported for bat assemblages in other natural regions of Colombia, where a higher diversity has been presumed. The differences observed in the structure of abundances of the assemblages studied here may be associated with ecosystem heterogeneity in the Llanos region, characterized by different types of vegetation structure in the various types of forest. In addition, there may be a negative effect of the degree of transformation of natural ecosystems on bat richness and diversity. On the other hand, the high degree of bat species turnover may stem from differences in the composition and structure of riparian forests coupled with the strong seasonality of precipitation in the region, as reported for other Neotropical savannas.},

	abstract = {1. Calibrating indices of animal abundance to true densities is critical in wildlife studies especially when direct density estimations are precluded by high costs, lack of required data or model parameters, elusiveness and rarity of target species. For studies deploying camera traps, the use of photographic rate (photographs per sampling time) as an index of abundance potentially applies to the majority of terrestrial mammals where individual recognition, and hence capture–recapture analysis, are unfeasible. The very few studies addressing this method have either been limited by lack of independence between trapping rates and density estimations, or because they combined different species, thus introducing potential bias in camera trap detection rates. This study uses a single model species from several sites to analyse calibration of trapping rates to independently derived estimations of density. The study also makes the first field test of the method by Rowcliffe et al. (2008) for density derivation from camera trapping rates based on modelling animal-camera contacts. 2. We deployed camera traps along line transects at six sites in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania and correlated trapping rates of Harvey’s duiker Cephalophus harveyi with densities estimated from counts made along the same transects. 3. We found a strong, linear relationship (R2 = 0·90) between trapping rate and density. Sampling precision analysis indicates that camera trapping rates reach satisfactory precision when trapping effort amounts to 250–300 camera days. Density estimates using Rowcliffe et al.’s (2008) gas model conversion are higher than from transect censuses; we discuss the possible reasons and stress the need for more field tests. 4. Synthesis and applications. Subject to rigorous and periodic calibration, and standardization of sampling procedures in time and over different sites, camera trapping rate is shown to be, in this study, a valid index of density in the target species. Comparative data indicate that this may also apply to forest ungulates in general. The method has great potential for standardizing monitoring programmes and reducing the costs of wildlife surveys, especially in remote areas.},

	abstract = {Optimal foraging theory predicts animals should balance foraging benefits (energy gain) with foraging cost (predation risk). It has been widely shown that food or resource levels are important in the selection of habitats. Other studies have shown the importance of cover as safe areas to decrease predation risk indicating the role of cover in habitat selection. With regards to lagomorphs, no studies have characterized vegetation cover and resource levels simultaneously. This study tested whether black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus), as predicted by optimal foraging theory, consider resource and predation risk levels in their habitat selection. We conducted our study in grassland and shrubland habitats in the Chihuahuan desert to test the following predictions: (1) in habitats with equal levels of predation risk, areas used more by jackrabbits will have higher resource levels; (2) between habitats with different levels of predation risk, the higher used low risk area will have lower resource levels. To test these predictions, we measured and compared the quantity of grass/forb species between a high use, low risk grassland and a low use, high risk shrubland and in areas of high and low jackrabbit use within these two habitats. We found less forbs and grasses in the high use grassland (linear density index (LDI)=48.1±12.4ind., grassland vs. 63.3±9.9 ind., shrubland, F1,27=19.1, p⩽0.005)). Inside habitats we found more forbs and grasses in the high use than the low use areas (LDI=83.1±11.4ind., high use vs. 30.4±5.2ind., low use, F1,27=177.7, p⩽0.001). These results supported our predictions and we concluded that optimal foraging theory helps explain habitat use by black-tailed jackrabbits in the Chihuahuan desert.},

	abstract = {Water often limits the distribution and productivity of wildlife in arid environments. Consequently, resource managers have constructed artificial water catchments (AWCs) in deserts of the southwestern United States, assuming that additional free water benefits wildlife. We tested this assumption by using data from acoustic and camera trap surveys to determine whether AWCs influenced the distributions of terrestrial mammals ({\textgreater}0.5 kg), birds, and bats in the Mojave Desert, California, USA. We sampled 200 sites in 2016–2017 using camera traps and acoustic recording units, 52 of which had AWCs. We identified detections to the species-level, and modeled occupancy for each of the 44 species of wildlife photographed or recorded. Artificial water catchments explained spatial variation in occupancy for 8 terrestrial mammals, 4 bats, and 18 bird species. Occupancy of 18 species was strongly and positively associated with AWCs, whereas 1 species (i.e., horned lark [Eremophila alpestris]) was negatively associated. Access to an AWC had a larger influence on species’ distributions than precipitation and slope and was nearly as influential as temperature. In our study area, AWCs functioned as an important influence on wildlife occupancy, which supports the long-held assumption that AWCs may benefit wildlife in arid habitats. We encourage managers to maintain existing AWCs, particularly those in areas forecasted to have the largest decrease in water availability. We also recommend long-term, systematic monitoring of AWCs, which will facilitate more informed management decisions. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {Palm oil is the most widely traded vegetable oil globally, with demand projected to increase substantially in the future. Almost all oil palm grows in areas that were once tropical moist forests, some of them quite recently. The conversion to date, and future expansion, threatens biodiversity and increases greenhouse gas emissions. Today, consumer pressure is pushing companies toward deforestation-free sources of palm oil. To guide interventions aimed at reducing tropical deforestation due to oil palm, we analysed recent expansions and modelled likely future ones. We assessed sample areas to find where oil palm plantations have recently replaced forests in 20 countries, using a combination of high-resolution imagery from Google Earth and Landsat. We then compared these trends to countrywide trends in FAO data for oil palm planted area. Finally, we assessed which forests have high agricultural suitability for future oil palm development, which we refer to as vulnerable forests, and identified critical areas for biodiversity that oil palm expansion threatens. Our analysis reveals regional trends in deforestation associated with oil palm agriculture. In Southeast Asia, 45\% of sampled oil palm plantations came from areas that were forests in 1989. For South America, the percentage was 31\%. By contrast, in Mesoamerica and Africa, we observed only 2\% and 7\% of oil palm plantations coming from areas that were forest in 1989. The largest areas of vulnerable forest are in Africa and South America. Vulnerable forests in all four regions of production contain globally high concentrations of mammal and bird species at risk of extinction. However, priority areas for biodiversity conservation differ based on taxa and criteria used. Government regulation and voluntary market interventions can help incentivize the expansion of oil palm plantations in ways that protect biodiversity-rich ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The inexorable expansion of oil palm plantations has been a major driver of biodiversity loss in the tropics. This is particularly evident in Malaysia and Indonesia, where the majority of the world's oil palm is cultivated. In Latin America oil palm acreage has also been steadily increasing, especially in countries such as Colombia, the largest producer by far. However, information on the biological implications of rapid land conversion to oil palm in the region remains scarce. Here, we review the state of knowledge about the impacts of oil palm on biodiversity in Colombia. We also discuss the conservation strategies that have been implemented in the country, and propose research that we need to develop best management practices. The vast majority of research has focused on biotechnology, soils, biological pest control, carbon stock and reduction of greenhouse gases emission, but research on biodiversity is very scarce, or is not published yet. However, important investment and research on this topic are being developed. The most threatened ecosystems are the savannas in the Orinoquia region, where most of the expansion is predicted. The demands for green markets and certification are slowly encouraging oil palm corporations to mitigate their ‘biological footprint‘. However, applied research on the possible impacts of oil palm on biodiversity are urgently needed to support conservation efforts in the oil-palm-dominated landscapes of Colombia, along with commitments by the government and companies to adopt the resulting recommendations.},

	abstract = {Biofuels are promoted worldwide as an alternative for the replacement of fossil fuels, especially in the transportation sector, although the extent to which biofuels can meet this need is unclear. Currently, oil palm is the most important crop used for biodiesel production in the world. The growth of oil palm plantations in Asia has often occurred at the expense of forest areas creating environmental concerns. Colombia is the fifth largest oil palm grower worldwide, and policies that provide subsidies have been enacted to ensure that Colombia plays an important role in future biodiesel markets. At that same time, many sectors of society are concerned that the negative effects of biofuels may be worse than the benefits. In this paper we analyze the land use transitions generated by the expansion of oil palm crops between 2002 and 2008; we identify the factors associated with the expansion and project the future expansion of plantations in Colombia by applying spatial regression analysis and econometric models. To model future expansion, we started with a map of oil palm plantations in 2008. An econometric model that incorporates the impact of governmental policies (normative and economic that support the biofuel sector) through a Time Series Intervention Model Analysis was used to estimate the cultivated area in 2020. To spatially project these estimates a spatial logistic regression model that incorporates biophysical and socioeconomic variables was used. Finally, future land use transitions associated with the expansion of oil palm plantations were analyzed. The results show that present and future oil palm expansion is concentrated in areas dominated by pastures, and to a lesser extent areas that are a mix of agricultural land and natural forests. Our results also suggest that it is highly unlikely that the government will reach its goal of over 3 million hectares of oil palm plantations by 2020 and the goal of biodiesel blends supplying 20\% of the national fuel needs.},

We estimated frequency of occurrence and percentage of occurrence for species of prey in the diet through analysis of scats (n = 117) and evaluated selection of prey by comparing availability against consumption, based on biomass and number of prey consumed as represented in scats. Bobcats consumed a wide variety of prey, but rodents and lagomorphs dominated the diet. Species of prey were not consumed according to availability; combined lagomorphs had the highest probability of being selected based on densities and biomass despite their lower availability. Within lagomorphs, based on their availability, rabbits (Sylvilagus audubonii) were selected more often than jackrabbits. By analyzing the availability and biomass of prey against its consumption, we determined that bobcats do not select prey for high availability but act as specialist foragers. Foraging theory provides the best explanation of dietary selection by bobcats in our study area.},

	abstract = {The abundance of low-density species like carnivores is logistically difficult to directly estimate at a meaningful scale. Predictive distribution models are often used as a surrogate for density estimation. But because density can continue to increase as occupancy asymptotes at 1, occupancy may have little value as an index, and home range expansion in marginal habitat may further confound the association. We sought to estimate bobcat population size at a landscape scale (14,286 km2) in central Wisconsin, which provided an opportunity to relate predicted occurrence to individual space use and population density. We sampled bobcats using motion-sensitive trail cameras at 9 arrays across central Wisconsin. We estimated bobcat site-specific occupancy, and regressed these estimates as linear or asymptotic functions of site-specific density to determine the strength and shape of their association. We subsequently modeled both parameters relative to habitat covariates and repeated the regression process. A linear functional relationship between density and occupancy was most supported when detection parameters were held constant (wi= 0.97, R2 = 0.72) and when detection, occurrence, and density were modeled as a function of habitat covariates (wi= 0.99, R2 = 0.95). This suggests that repeated presence-absence data alone may be an efficient and reliable method for inferring spatial patterns in bobcat density or identifying habitat types with greater density potential in the northern parts of its range. Bobcat occupancy and density were both positively associated with surrounding woody cover and wetland edge density. Our most supported spatially explicit capture-recapture model estimated bobcat abundance as 362 adult individuals (95\% CI 272–490) across the study area. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {Context. Accurate density estimation is crucial for conservation and management of elusive species. Camera-trapping may provide an efficient method for density estimation, particularly when analysed with recently developed spatially explicit capture–recapture (SECR) models. Although camera-traps are employed extensively to estimate large carnivore density, their use for smaller carnivores has been limited. Moreover, while camera-trapping studies are typically conducted at local scales, the utility of analysing larger-scale patterns by combining multiple camera studies remains poorly known.Aims. The goal of the present study was to develop a better understanding of the utility of SECR models and camera-trapping for the estimation of density of small carnivores at local and regional scales.Methods. Based on data collected from camera-traps, we used SECR to examine density of bobcats (Lynx rufus) at four study sites in north-central Texas. We then combined our density estimates with previous estimates (from multiple methodologies) across the bobcat’s geographic range, and used linear regression to examine drivers of range-wide density patterns.Key results. Bobcat densities averaged 13.2 per 100 km2 across all four study sites, and were lowest at the site in the most heavily modified landscape. Bobcat capture probability was positively related to forest cover around camera-trap sites. At the range-wide scale, 53\% of the variation in density was explained by just two factors: temperature and longitude.Conclusions. Our results demonstrate the utility of camera-traps, combined with SECR, to generate precise density estimates for mesocarnivores, and reveal the negative effects of landscape disturbance on bobcat populations. The associations revealed in our range-wide analysis, despite variability in techniques used to estimate density, demonstrate how a combination of multiple density estimates for a species can be used for large-scale inference. However, improvement in our understanding of biogeographic density patterns for mesocarnivores could be obtained from a greater number of camera-based density estimates across the range of a species, combined with meta-analytic techniques.Implications. Camera-trapping and SECR should be more widely applied to generate local density estimates for many small and medium-sized carnivores, where at least a portion of the individuals are identifiable. If such estimates are more widely obtained, meta-analytic techniques could be used to test biogeographic predictions or for large-scale monitoring efforts.},

	abstract = {Abundance estimation of carnivore populations is difficult and has prompted the use of non-invasive detection methods, such as remotely-triggered cameras, to collect data. To analyze photo data, studies focusing on carnivores with unique pelage patterns have utilized a mark-recapture framework and studies of carnivores without unique pelage patterns have used a mark-resight framework. We compared mark-resight and mark-recapture estimation methods to estimate bobcat (Lynx rufus) population sizes, which motivated the development of a new "hybrid" mark-resight model as an alternative to traditional methods. We deployed a sampling grid of 30 cameras throughout the urban southern California study area. Additionally, we physically captured and marked a subset of the bobcat population with GPS telemetry collars. Since we could identify individual bobcats with photos of unique pelage patterns and a subset of the population was physically marked, we were able to use traditional mark-recapture and mark-resight methods, as well as the new “hybrid” mark-resight model we developed to estimate bobcat abundance. We recorded 109 bobcat photos during 4,669 camera nights and physically marked 27 bobcats with GPS telemetry collars. Abundance estimates produced by the traditional mark-recapture, traditional mark-resight, and “hybrid” mark-resight methods were similar, however precision differed depending on the models used. Traditional mark-recapture and mark-resight estimates were relatively imprecise with percent confidence interval lengths exceeding 100\% of point estimates. Hybrid mark-resight models produced better precision with percent confidence intervals not exceeding 57\%. The increased precision of the hybrid mark-resight method stems from utilizing the complete encounter histories of physically marked individuals (including those never detected by a camera trap) and the encounter histories of naturally marked individuals detected at camera traps. This new estimator may be particularly useful for estimating abundance of uniquely identifiable species that are difficult to sample using camera traps alone.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Estimating population size of elusive and rare species is challenging. The difficulties in catching such species has triggered the use of samples collected noninvasively, such as feces or hair, from which genetic analysis yields data similar to capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data. There are, however, two differences between classical CMR and noninvasive CMR. First, capture and recapture data are gathered over multiple sampling sessions in classical CMR, whereas in noninvasive CMR they can be obtained from a single sampling session. Second, because of genotyping errors and unlike classical CMR, there is no simple relationship between (genetic) marks and individuals in noninvasive CMR. We evaluated, through simulations, the reliability of population size estimates based on noninvasive CMR. For equal sampling efforts, we compared estimates of population size N obtained from accumulation curves, a maximum likelihood, and a Bayesian estimator. For a closed population and without sampling heterogeneity, estimates obtained from noninvasive CMR were as reliable as estimates from classical CMR. The sampling structure (single or multiple session) did not alter the results, the Bayesian estimator in the case of a single sampling session presented the best compromise between low mean squared error and a 95\% confidence interval encompassing the parametric value of N in most simulations. Finally, when suitable field and lab protocols were used, genotyping errors did not substantially bias population size estimates (bias {\textless} 3.5\% in all simulations). The ability to reliably estimate population size from noninvasive samples taken during a single session offers a new and useful technique for the management and conservation of elusive and rare species.},

	abstract = {Abundance estimators are often evaluated with simulations, or by comparing estimates to populations of known size. Advances in noninvasive genetic sampling have fueled an increase in the use of noninvasive genetic sampling-based capture–recapture. However, when working with free-ranging populations of unknown size, managers often lack data necessary to select the appropriate estimator. This leads to uncertainty regarding how choice of estimator or sampling design influence estimates, and managers may select estimators based on funding or logistical constraints. Alternatively, comparing estimates from multiple estimators can provide managers with greater confidence in estimates, or highlight potential differences. We used noninvasive genetic sampling to estimate the abundance of free-ranging kit foxes Vulpes macrotis and coyotes Canis latrans. We generated estimates of abundance with two non-spatial likelihood-based estimators: 1) robust design Huggins capture–recapture models and 2) single-occasion capture with replacement (CAPWIRE) models. We compared these with recently published estimates derived from spatially explicit capture–recapture (SECR) models. For both species, estimates from Huggins models were generally lower than those from SECR. Abundance estimates from CAPWIRE, which was developed specifically for noninvasive genetic sampling and generates estimates from a single sampling occasion, tended to be biased low with high precision. Our results suggest that choice of estimator and sampling design can significantly influence estimates, and that the relationship between estimators varied between species. Our results further suggest that single-occasion sampling often employed with CAPWIRE abundance estimation may produce biased results and be inappropriate for species requiring dispersed sampling strategies.},

	abstract = {Habitat heterogeneity might to promote the abundance and richness of natural enemies potentially leading to higher top-down pressure on herbivorous insects. Heterogeneous habitats could provide natural enemies with more abundant and alternative resources and a greater variety of micro-habitats. Natural enemies with different searching behaviours, e.g. generalists and specialists, could be affected in different ways by habitat heterogeneity, thus affecting their pressure on herbivorous insects. To understand how top-down pressure on herbivorous insects is promoted by habitat heterogeneity, it is crucial to investigate which parameters contributing to habitat heterogeneity affect not only the abundance and richness but also the searching behaviour of different natural enemies. We investigated the relationship between heterogeneity in forest habitats and the top-down pressure exerted by generalist predators and specialist parasitoids on larvae of the European pine sawfly (Neodiprion sertifer). We used forest stands with endemic or epidemic densities of resident sawfly populations, within each stand we selected experimental trees to create variation in tree species diversity and density in their surrounding area, i.e. habitat heterogeneity. We found that a higher tree density increased the predation by generalists on sawfly larvae in stands with endemic sawfly densities. Parasitoids were less successful in stands with endemic sawfly densities. Total mortality depended on stand character and the proportion of pine around experimental trees. The explained variation in the response variables by the models is relatively low, indicating that other measures of heterogeneity, like understory vegetation and presence of dead wood could contribute to the observed variation. Also, interference between generalist and specialist enemies could affect the realized mortality pressure. Thus, the effect of tree species diversity in combination with these other measures of heterogeneity needs to be recognized to promote the presence and the activity of natural enemies in managed habitats.},

	abstract = {The presence of exotic predators in ecosystems across the world is a leading driver of native species’ declines. Exotic predators largely influence native species through predation and harassment, which may cause native species to avoid them spatially. We used a camera trap dataset from seven sites in Madagascar's largest protected area complex to investigate spatial co-occurrence patterns between three exotic predators (free-ranging domestic dogs Canis familiaris and cats Felis silvestris, and small Indian civet Viverricula indica) and native ground-dwelling forest birds (n = 5) and small mammals (n = 4). We created 216 two-species occupancy models for 27 exotic predator-native species pairings to examine how habitat, exotic predator presence or both, influenced each native species’ occupancy and/or detection. We found that native bird and small mammal occupancy and/or detection were strongly related to an exotic predator's presence 52\% of the time (i.e. 14 of 27 exotic predator-native species pairings). Six of the 14 species pairings (i.e. 43\%) had non-independent co-occurrence patterns, four of which were habitat-mediated. The effect of exotic predator presence on native species’ detection was largely negative, depressing native species’ detection in seven out of 12 instances (i.e. 58\% of the time). The small Indian civet and free-ranging cats each strongly influenced the occupancy and/or detection of six species for a combined impact on seven native species, while domestic dogs strongly influenced two species. By including habitat covariates in two-species occupancy models, we gained deeper insight into the effect exotic predator presence has on native species’ distribution. We also note that the strong effect of exotic predator presence on our ability to detect native species can hinder the ability of researchers to provide accurate parameter estimates. We recommend future research into the synergistic effects that habitat degradation and exotic species presence has on native species.},

Using A. arktos as a model species, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of infrared digital camera traps for detecting and differentiating small mammals and to comment on the broad applicability of this methodology. We also sought to understand how the detection probabilities of our target species varied over time and characterize their activity patterns. We installed 11 infrared cameras at one of only three known sites where A. arktos occurs for five consecutive deployments. Cameras were fixed to wooden stakes and oriented vertically, 35 cm above ground, directly facing bait containers. Using this method, we successfully recorded and identified individuals from all four species of small mammal known previously in the area from live trapping, including A. arktos. This validates the effectiveness of the infrared camera type and orientation for small mammal studies. Periods of activity for all species were highly coincident, showing a strong peak in activity during the same two-hour period immediately following sunset. A. arktos, A. stuartii and M. cervinipes also displayed a strong negative linear relationship between detection probability and days since deployment. This is an important finding for camera trapping generally, indicating that routine camera deployment lengths (of one-to-two weeks) between baiting events may be too long when targeting some small mammals.},

Examples include community assembly, equilibrium versus non-equilibrium organization of communities, resource partitioning and ecological character displacement, the local–regional species diversity relationship, and the metacommunity concept. Traditionally, co-occurrence has been measured and tested at the level of an entire species presence–absence matrix wherein various algorithms are used to randomize matrices and produce statistical null distributions of metrics that quantify structure in the matrix. This approach implicitly recognizes a presence–absence matrix as having some real ecological identity (e.g. a set of species exhibiting nestedness among a set of islands) in addition to being a unit of statistical analysis. An emerging alternative is to test for non-random co-occurrence between paired species. The pairwise approach does not analyse matrix-level structure and thus views a species pair as the fundamental unit of co-occurrence. Inferring process from pattern is very difﬁcult in analyses of co-occurrence; however, the pairwise approach may make this task easier by simplifying the analysis and resulting inferences to associations between paired species.},

	abstract = {Co-occurrence methods are increasingly utilized in ecology to infer networks of species interactions where detailed knowledge based on empirical studies is difficult to obtain. Their use is particularly common, but not restricted to, microbial networks constructed from metagenomic analyses. In this study, we test the efficacy of this procedure by comparing an inferred network constructed using spatially intensive co-occurrence data from the rocky intertidal zone in central Chile to a well-resolved, empirically based, species interaction network from the same region. We evaluated the overlap in the information provided by each network and the extent to which there is a bias for co-occurrence data to better detect known trophic or non-trophic, positive or negative interactions. We found a poor correspondence between the co-occurrence network and the known species interactions with overall sensitivity (probability of true link detection) equal to 0.469, and specificity (true non-interaction) equal to 0.527. The ability to detect interactions varied with interaction type. Positive non-trophic interactions such as commensalism and facilitation were detected at the highest rates. These results demonstrate that co-occurrence networks do not represent classical ecological networks in which interactions are defined by direct observations or experimental manipulations. Co-occurrence networks provide information about the joint spatial effects of environmental conditions, recruitment, and, to some extent, biotic interactions, and among the latter, they tend to better detect niche-expanding positive non-trophic interactions. Detection of links (sensitivity or specificity) was not higher for well-known intertidal keystone species than for the rest of consumers in the community. Thus, as observed in previous empirical and theoretical studies, patterns of interactions in co-occurrence networks must be interpreted with caution, especially when extending interaction-based ecological theory to interpret network variability and stability. Co-occurrence networks may be particularly valuable for analysis of community dynamics that blends interactions and environment, rather than pairwise interactions alone.},

Indirect interaction chains are composed of links provided by direct interactions. We analyzed previously published data on 20 assemblages of species. Chain strengths were estimated by the weakest link and by the product of link strength. The average strength of the interaction chain decreased with increasing numbers of links with both models. Positive indirect interactions in chains with an even number of links offset negative direct interactions. We set the community size by the chain length where 95\% of the indirect interactions are weaker than 10\% of the mean of the absolute value of direct interaction strength. Using the multiplicative model, seven assemblages had a community size (web of interaction length) of three links, one of four links, and the remainder of communities were too small to set community size. The analysis suggests that effective communities of size are rarely investigated in ecological experiments.},

	abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an 'observer' of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

	abstract = {Mammalian carnivores have suffered the biggest range contraction among all biodiversity and are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. Therefore, we identified priority areas for the conservation of mammalian carnivores, while accounting for species-specific requirements for connectivity and expected agricultural and urban expansion. While prioritizing for carnivores only, we were also able to test their effectiveness as surrogates for 23,110 species of amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles and 867 terrestrial ecoregions. We then assessed the risks to carnivore conservation within each country that makes a contribution to global carnivore conservation. We found that land use change will potentially lead to important range losses, particularly amongst already threatened carnivore species. In addition, the 17\% of land targeted for protection under the Aichi Target 11 was found to be inadequate to conserve carnivores under expected land use change. Our results also highlight that land use change will decrease the effectiveness of carnivores to protect other threatened species, especially threatened amphibians. In addition, the risk of human-carnivore conflict is potentially high in countries where we identified spatial priorities for their conservation. As meeting the global biodiversity target will be inadequate for carnivore protection, innovative interventions are needed to conserve carnivores outside protected areas to compliment any proposed expansion of the protected area network.},

Of the 165 species of small carnivores recognised during the process, two are Extinct (EX), one is Critically Endangered (CR), ten are Endangered (EN), 22 Vulnerable (VU), ten Near Threatened (NT), 15 Data Deficient (DD) and 105 Least Concern. Thus, 22\% of the species for which a category was assigned other than DD were assessed as threatened (i.e. CR, EN or VU), as against 25\% for mammals as a whole. Among otters, seven (58\%) of the 12 species for which a category was assigned were identified as threatened. This reflects their attachment to rivers and other waterbodies, and heavy trade-driven hunting. The IUCN Red List species accounts are living documents to be updated annually, and further information to refine listings is welcome.},

	abstract = {The potential for strong competition among small sympatric carnivores results in a need for coexistence strategies whereby competitors partition along spatial, temporal and dietary axes as a means to reduce ecological overlaps. We determined spatial and temporal partitioning patterns of a guild of small African carnivores: the African wildcat Felis silvestris lybica, grey mongoose Galerella pulverulenta, small-spotted genet Genetta genetta, striped polecat Ictonyx striatus, and the yellow mongoose Cynictis penicillata. We quantified the degree of spatial and temporal co-occurrence of the small carnivores using camera trap data over a year-long period. Carnivores separated into two temporal groups: nocturnal species (wildcat, polecat and genet) and diurnal species (mongooses). In addition, carnivores within the same temporal group had strong patterns of reduced spatial co-occurrence. The smaller bodied carnivores showed lower co-occurrence with the larger bodied African wildcat than expected by chance, supporting the idea of dominant competitor avoidance. Thus, small carnivores likely minimise competitive interactions through spatio-temporal habitat partitioning.},

	abstract = {Rare and elusive species are seldom the first choice of model for the study of ecological questions, yet rarity and elusiveness often emerge from ecological processes. One of these processes is interspecific killing, the most extreme form of interference competition among carnivores. Subdominant species can avoid falling victim to other carnivores through spatial and/or temporal separation. The smallest carnivore species, including members of the Mustelidae, are typically the most threatened by other predators but are also exceedingly challenging to study in the wild. As a consequence, we have only limited knowledge of how the most at-risk members of carnivore communities deal with being both hunters and hunted. We explored whether activity and space use of a little-known small carnivore, the Altai mountain weasel Mustela altaica, reflect the activity and distribution of its main prey, pika Ochotona sp., and two sympatric predators, the stone marten Martes foina and the red fox Vulpes vulpes. Spatial and temporal patterns of photographic captures in Pakistan's northern mountains suggest that weasels may cope with being both predator and prey by frequenting areas used by pikas while exhibiting diurnal activity that contrasts with that of the mostly nocturnal/crepuscular stone marten and red fox. Camera trap studies are now common and are staged in many different ecosystems. The data yielded offer an opportunity not only to fill knowledge gaps concerning less-studied species but also to non-invasively test ecological hypotheses linked with rarity and elusiveness.},

	abstract = {Within a large carnivore guild, subordinate competitors (African wild dog, Lycaon pictus, and cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus) might reduce the limiting effects of dominant competitors (lion, Panthera leo, and spotted hyena, Crocuta crocuta) by avoiding them in space, in time, or through patterns of prey selection. Understanding how these competitors cope with one other can inform strategies for their conservation. We tested how mechanisms of niche partitioning promote coexistence by quantifying patterns of prey selection and the use of space and time by all members of the large carnivore guild within Liuwa Plain National Park in western Zambia. Lions and hyenas specialized on wildebeest, whereas wild dogs and cheetahs selected broader diets including smaller and less abundant prey. Spatially, cheetahs showed no detectable avoidance of areas heavily used by dominant competitors, but wild dogs avoided areas heavily used by lions. Temporally, the proportion of kills by lions and hyenas did not detectably differ across four time periods (day, crepuscular, early night, and late night), but wild dogs and especially cheetahs concentrated on time windows that avoided nighttime hunting by lions and hyenas. Our results provide new insight into the conditions under which partitioning may not allow for coexistence for one subordinate species, the African wild dog, while it does for cheetah. Because of differences in responses to dominant competitors, African wild dogs may be more prone to competitive exclusion (local extirpation), particularly in open, uniform ecosystems with simple (often wildebeest dominated) prey communities, where spatial avoidance is difficult.},
